195.	 May I offer you, Sir, the warm congratulations of the Nigerian delegation on your election as President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly.
196.	Your personal qualities as a diplomat and statesman and your wisdom and long experience in the affairs of the United Nations will, I am sure, make your tenure of this high office as memorable as that of your predecessor, Edvard Flambro of Norway.
197.	At the commemorative twenty-fifth session of the United Nations, last year, the General Assembly adopted four documents: a program of action for the full implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 2621 (XXV)]; the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]; the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV)]; and a reaffirmation of the dedication of States Members of the United Nations to the objectives and purposes of the Charter and to the anniversary Objectives of peace, justice and progress [resolution 2627 (XXV)].
19S. The Government and people of the Federal Republic of Nigeria believe that the effectiveness or otherwise of the United Nations will be judged by the determination of the United Nations to meet the challenges and achieve the objectives so movingly set out in the Organization's own declarations.
199.	Unfortunately, even a cursory review of the world situation will show that the rate of progress, if any, in achieving the objectives set out in the General Assembly'; declarations at the 1970 commemorative session has been disappointing. You will permit me to refer to the situation in the southern parts of my own continent, Africa, to illustrate the continuing frustration of the ideals and goals to which we all are committed in this Organization and which must be implemented in the interest of the United Nations and the whole of mankind.
200.	We have all witnessed the steady and deplorable deterioration in the situation in southern Africa during the last few years. In many parts of southern Africa repressive minority Governments continue to hold large populations of Africans in bondage and to inflict the most humiliating and brutal assault on them in defiance of world opinion and in contravention of the very fundamentals of the Charter of this Organization. It is a matter for serious regret that in spite of repeated exhortations, and in spite of the universal expressions of distress and disgust over the situation in southern Africa, the intransigence of the colonial or white minority Governments still continue unchecked and unabated.
201.	We have before us the recent historic pronouncement, in the form of an advisory opinion, of the International Court of Justice regarding the situation in Namibia.  The world Court has categorically stated that South African presence in that Territory is illegal. That memorable pronouncement can only be given effect if this Organization rises to its duty and its obligations in order to implement, especially in such a clear and indisputable situation, some of the ideals and objectives which the General Assembly and other organs of the United Nations have repeatedly asserted in the past. The unambiguous and unequivocal declaration of the world Court is a challenge to this Organization. South Africa still remains in illegal and defiant occupation of a Territory to which it has no legitimate or legal claim. The major task of this twenty- sixth session of the General Assembly would, therefore, be to devise ways and means of re-establishing without further delay United Nations authority in the Territory.
202.	The Zimbabwe people still languish under the oppression of a misguided group of adventurers who usurped the rights of the people and established a totally unrepresentative and illegal administration over the United Kingdom colony of Southern Rhodesia. Clearly, all f^'-minded and objective observers have come to the conclusion that the pious hopes that were assiduously pressed upon us some time ago that this illegal Government would be removed by the application of economic sanctions have not been realized. Meanwhile, brutality against the rightful owners of the land and the usurpation of their freedom continue unabated. Leading nationalists and leaders of the people of Zimbabwe are still being held without just cause in cruel imprisonment and under the most inhuman and degrading circumstances. Many have been killed in the defense of their elementary human right to exist; others have died in prison.
203.	We have before us a strange spectacle. For the first time in British colonial history, an unmitigated act of open rebellion and high treason against the Crown has not been crushed or dislodged. There are now widespread fears in some quarters that the legitimate and responsible Government for that Territory-I refer to the United Kingdom Government-may have lost its will to assert its sovereign authority in Rhodesia and to undertake its sacred duty to prepare the people of Zimbabwe for orderly, rapid and urgent progress towards genuine independence. The whole world is watching that situation with anxiety, bearing in mind the repeated assurances that had been given to the world that any political solution in Rhodesia would be based on the principles of equal rights, responsibilities and duties for all its citizens, without discrimination as to color or creed.
204.	Elsewhere in the continent of Africa, especially in the southern parts thereof colonial exploitation and undisguised oppression still continue. No progress has been made, since the declarations of the last session of the General Assembly, in the situation of the African Territories controlled by Portugal. On the contrary, the Security Council has had evidence, on the basis of a report by an impartial fact-finding committee, of a direct and outrageous armed incursion and invasion into the Territory and capital of an independent, sovereign African country. This flagrant act of open aggression against the United Nations Charter and the elementary principles of international law is compounded by reports of further designs on the part of Portugal to continue this policy of naked aggression and intimidation of African countries situated near its colonial Territories. The spirit of the oppressed peoples is not crushed, however, and the struggle for freedom goes on in the Territories under the colonial domination of Portugal. But there is, alas, no sign of the colonial authorities' initiating the legitimate and rational steps that would end confrontation and conflict and begin the preparation of those Territories for independence and fruitful cooperation.
205.	In South Africa, the Government persists in pursuing, in the name of its national interest, the horrors and inhuman policies of apartheid which seriously offend the spirit and the Charter of this great Organization, and the conscience of the world. It is, of course, universally acknowledged that the South African Government is much assisted in its repressive policies by the support it receives from some prominent Member States of this Organization, and is thereby emboldened to continue in its inventions of additional methods of terror and oppression against the poor, defenseless black population. Not only the legitimate nationalist leaders, but even universally respected prelates of the Church, now fall victim to the capricious reign of terror unleashed upon the population of that unhappy country. The threats of the South African Government to the security and independence of sovereign African States continue with impunity. This Organization and the whole world look on in horror while those great Powers which have the influence and the means to check this steady deterioration in that part of the world stand idly by, wringing their hands in pretended agony.
206.	In the light of the well-documented record of cruel oppression and blatant racial discrimination against the black population in South Africa, many people have rightly viewed with skepticism the recently reported desire of the authorities in South Africa to engage in a dialog with other countries and Governments on the African continent. This skepticism arises from the basic fact that it is illogical, even ludicrous, for the South African Government to refuse to meet and accept the black citizens of its own country on terms of equality, while pretending to want contacts with leaders of independent African States. Unless the whole effort is a ruse to deflect African and world attention from the cruel inhumanities which characterize the rule of the present Government in South Africa, it is difficult to understand why such dialogs should not begin at home, within South Africa itself.
207.	I make no apologies for speaking so long on the situation in Africa, because it is one part of the world where the glaring examples of historical inequities and racial injustice remain unresolved and are pursued with impunity by those who perpetrate them. It is our conviction that the solution of those problems, and indeed the urgency and dispatch with which they are resolved, will seriously affect the faith of mankind, especially in the developing world, in the validity of the claim' and assumptions on which the ideals of the United Nations are based,
208.	My delegation deeply regrets the lack of substantial improvement in the Middle East situation over the last year, The fragile peace, or rather the fragile state of near-conflict, which subsists in that area of the world is a source of continued concern to all peace-loving people. The Organization of African Unity has, as you may be aware, felt so strongly on this subject that the Heads of State and Government of Africa set up a committee of 10 heads of African States for the purpose of doing what we in Africa can do to assist in the process of finding a solution to the situation in the Middle East. Nigeria, as a member of that committee, will co-operate fully in every effort to reach an equitable and honorable solution that will take into account all the main elements of that confused and tangled situation. For us in Nigeria, Security Council resolution 242 (1967) still remains the best hope, and still contains the most acceptable principles, for a genuine solution to the Middle East situation.
209.	Let me mention that the Committee established by the Organization of African Unity is not an alternative to the valiant and highly commendable efforts of Ambassador Gunnar Jarring in his mission as the Secretary-General's Special Representative to the Middle East. On the contrary, the functions of the new Committee of the Organization of African Unity will be complementary to the efforts of the United Nations. The African Committee is an impartial, yet deeply concerned, body which hopes that it can convey to the principal parties in the dispute a sense of the agony and concern of Africa as a whole over the increasingly dangerous situation in the Middle East.
210.	One of the crucial issues before this Assembly is the question of the representation of the Chinese people in the United Nations. My delegation is gratified to note that, this year, even those who, for nearly 25 years past, have sought to Prevent the seating of the representatives of the People's Republic of China in this Organization have now found the movement of world opinion inevitable, and have themselves moved somewhat from their previous opposition to the People's Republic taking its rightful place in the councils of the world. It was evident from the record of voting on this issue last year [1913th meeting], that a substantial majority of Member States represented in this Organization had publicly acknowledged that it is an untenable proposition for a Government representing nearly a quarter of mankind to continue to be prevented from participating in the deliberations and activities of the United Nations. The Nigerian position on this issue has always been clear and simple, We have always indicated that the representatives of such a large, populous and important nation should legitimately take their place in the United Nations Organization. We have always said that there is a popular error in describing this issue as the question of the 'admission of China'. China has always been a Member of this Organization and is, in fact, a permanent member of the Security Council. The issue before the General Assembly is, therefore, a question of which of the administrations claiming rightful representation of China should legitimately occupy that seat. There is no doubt in our mind that, in the circumstances, the People's Republic of China should take its rightful place in this Organization, My delegation will express itself more fully on this subject when this particular issue comes to be discussed in this Assembly.
211.	Owing to the deep points of difference between the great Powers, without whose agreement no progress would be possible in this particular case, the Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations has witnessed an impasse since 1969. Differences over the establishment of observer missions, their direction and control and the relevant, legal and financial arrangements have not been resolved. Over the past two years it has not been possible to reach agreement on the respective roles of the Security Council and the General Assembly on the important question of authorization of missions and, therefore, no work could be done on the definition and task of peace-keeping operations involving military contingents. The present state of affairs is clearly frustrating. We believe in the usefulness of the United Nations peace-keeping role in appropriate circumstances and we hope that renewed efforts will be made during the current session to break the impasse.
212.	My delegation places a high priority on the urgent need for progress in the area of disarmament, especially in the face of the constantly growing and multiplying stocks of armaments, including nuclear weapons of unspeakable horror, developed and stockpiled by some advanced countries. The situation, already urgent and pressing, is Complicated by the fact that a number of other countries may well be on the way to developing their own nuclear capabilities. It is true that a few useful but highly limited achievements have been recorded in the general question of disarmament; but my delegation must register its disappointment at the lack of more substantial progress in this matter.
213.	While Nigeria takes solace from the reported measure of progress in the Strategic Arms limitation Talks between the Governments of the United States and of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, we cannot but express our disappointment at the minimal results of the negotiations on disarmament being conducted in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament. It is tragic that, after all these years, no agreement has yet been reached on a comprehensive test ban. In fact, the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament has hardly torched the issue this year. Also, although the agreement on a draft convention on the prohibition of the development) production and stockpiling of bacteriological (biological) and toxin weapons and on their destruction [AI8457-DC/234, annex A] is a definite step towards the fulfillment of mankind's yearning to be rid of the danger and the burden of frightening armaments, my delegation feels, nevertheless, that a greater willingness, and a clear demonstration of it, by the great Powers to co-operate in the urgent search for wider and more effective disarmament arrangements, is very much needed. Nigeria, as a member of the conference, has always held the view that both chemical and biological weapons form a whole, and prohibition of both types of destructive weapons should equally engage the serious attention of all. The General Assembly endorsed this view last year [resolution 2662 (XXV)]. It is, therefore, disappointing that the agreement so far concluded was limited to biological weapons. We are, of course, aware that negotiations for an agreement to ban chemical weapons will, it is promised, be continued in the days ahead. However, we recall that a similar commitment was made in respect of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] with regard to a ban on underground tests; but we all know that that commitment which was said to be made 'in good faith' has not yet been implemented by those concerned. My delegation will have more to say on this in the appropriate Committee.
214.	The present decade has been designated as the Second United Nations Development Decade. It is a simple statement of fact that the First United Nations Development Decade did not satisfy the expectations of many Member States. As we now enter the second year of the Second Development Decade, my delegation hopes that a change of attitude and concept will be manifested, especially on the part of the advanced countries, if the objectives of the Development Decade are to be fulfilled. The reluctance of some advanced countries to contribute to the development of the less advanced areas of the world should be overcome. Although we in Nigeria do not believe that true economic independence can be built on charity, we nevertheless recognize the continued need for a flow of technical expertise and equipment, and in some cases of capital, from the industrialized countries to the less advantageously placed areas of the world, to enable the latter to prepare their economies towards a desirable level of development.
215.	In this connexion I wish to draw attention to the co-operative efforts of African countries to establish a road link between Mombasa on the east coast of Africa and Lagos on the west, a project which we believe deserves the support of the international community.
216.	My delegation looks forward to the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. We also welcome the proposed meeting in Lima of the Group of 77. We hope that these conferences will evolve a global trade strategy which can revitalize international commerce and promote mutual benefit for the advanced and the developing countries alike.
217.	One cannot conclude even this brief review of the world situation without reference to the recent events in the economic and monetary arrangements of the world which have seriously affected the orderly development of legitimate transactions between the Member States of this Organization. These events have also affected the economic basis of the development of many less advanced countries.
218.	Recent economic and financial measures adopted by some powerful countries have inevitably disorganized we 
hope only for a brief period international trade and payments arrangements that have been in force for nearly three decades. We acknowledge that the Bretton Woods agreements of 1944 and the policies and practices set out in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade have not always been perfect. On the other hand, it must be acknowledged that world trade and international commerce have experienced a 'considerable degree of satisfactorily progressive expansion during the past 25 years, Today the financial measures taken by a few advanced and powerful countries with highly developed economics have caused uncertainties which will have a serious effect on the development processes of the countries whose economies are not so advanced. No one can deny a Member State of this Organization its right to take such action as it considers necessary in its own national interest. We mast, however, express the anxiety that such measures taken in the national interest should always embrace and take into account the need for promoting a continued, orderly, international economic arrangement, without which the whole process of international development would be jeopardized.
219.	Evidently, it is now essential for those whose policies have had the effect of disorganizing the existing arrangements to take the initiative of instituting and ensuring the necessary wide-ranging consultations, either in the existing international monetary and financial bodies or by other means, with a view to establishing new and more generally agreed, even if not universally acclaimed, arrangements for the regularizing of international monetary affairs and the free exchange of goods and services between nations. It is our sincere hope that any such measures or any such consultations would fully involve the developing countries, which constitute an important element in world trade and whose fortunes and future development depend on a stable international order. Indeed, any solution of world economic and political problems must involve the developing countries, especially in the preparation or examination of the means designed to achieve such solutions.
220.	Nigeria shares the concern of the international community about the misuse of the environment in both developed and developing countries. We acknowledge the importance of United Nations responsibility in this field and we pledge our full support for, and active participation in, the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment which is scheduled to take place at Stockholm in 1972. Similarly, my Government and my delegation have followed with close interest the work of the sea-bed Committee  because we believe that the uses of the high seas and the exploitation of the sea-bed through the development of modern technology are vital issues for the future of the world's resources. My delegation will express its opinion more fully on this issue in the relevant Committee.
221.	The tasks that face our Organization have not always been easy nor have the procedures, which have been followed been as economical as might be desired. My delegation therefore welcomes the efforts which are being made rationalize the procedures and organization of the General Assembly. The aim, in our view, should be to save time and to reduce the volume of documentation without impairing the efficiency of the functioning of the General Assembly and other United Nations organs. To this end, my delegation expects that the recommendations of the Special Committee on the Rationalization of the Procedures and Organization of the General Assembly will be sympathetically considered and adopted by the General Assembly [see A/8426}.
222.	Lastly, on behalf of the Government and people of Nigeria, I wish to pay tribute to our beloved Secretary-General, U Thant, for his sterling- qualities and outstanding statesmanship and for his invaluable services to this Organization and to the whole of mankind. I salute him for his devotion and dedication to the ideals of the United Nations. Reports of .'lie decision of this dedicated servant of peace and distinguished statesman not to offer himself for continued service in his present post have been received with deep regret in my country. We firmly believe that not only this era, but also the future history of this Organization and of mankind will fully acknowledge the great services which he has performed and the imprint of calm and wisdom he left upon this Organization and the community of mankind.


1972

Mr. President, it is for me a pleasant duty to congratulate you on your election as President of this session of the General Assembly. Your long experience in the service of your country, as well as your sterling qualities as a statesman and a diplomat, eminently qualify you to discharge effectively the duties attendant upon your high office. The record of your service since the opening of this session has already justified the confidence reposed in you by the Members of our Organization.
99.	I want also to place on record the Nigerian delegation's appreciation of the services rendered as President of the Assembly during the last year by Adam Malik, the Foreign Minister of Indonesia, whose occupancy of the presidential chair not only did great credit to his own country but also enhanced Afro-Asian co-operation in tackling very explosive world crises and delicate situations in the General Assembly.
100.	Permit me further to take this opportunity to extend my congratulations to the Secretary-General of our Organization, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, on the energetic and efficient manner in which he has started to grapple with the heavy burden of his office.
101.	Since the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly there have been some positive trends towards an improvement in the world situation. The era of detente, which was ushered in by increased contact between the super-Powers, is gradually lessening international tensions; the balance of terror which had formed the basis of the uneasy peace between these super-Powers and their allies is gradually giving place to a reconciliation of interests. The People's Republic of China, following the historic decision taken by the General Assembly last year [resolution 2758(XXVI)], has assumed its legitimate place in the community of nations and its representative had the opportunity, only last month, of presiding over the most important organ of the United Nations, the Security Council. These developments, by reducing the dangers of global war, have made significant contributions to the maintenance of world peace and security, and the realization of the purposes and principles of the Organization.
102.	However, we cannot pretend to be unaware of some of the problems which detente may create if we do not consciously guard against them. There will increasingly arise the tendency on the part of a few to see themselves as the sole arbiters of international peace and security and to seek solutions outside the United Nations to world problems which affect us all, great and small alike.
103.	While the recent Moscow agreements, for instance, have been hailed as a positive step towards disarmament, there is no denying that their significance would have been even greater had they been worked out within the United Nations Conference of the Committee on Disarmament. We realize, of course, that even within that Committee the necessity for 'political realism', to quote a common phrase, is increasingly being invoked as a justification for special privileges for some members, thus restricting the role of others.
104.	The small, the medium-sized and the developing countries as a whole must seek active participation in the development of a world order in which all countries will be secure, and the interests of all peoples safeguarded. For us in Africa, the improvement in the world situation will be more meaningful if and when it brings the wind of change to the colonial and racial situation in Southern Africa. As far back as 1960, this Organization, by its resolution 1514 (XV), committed itself to the total liberation of colonial Territories and the granting of self-determination to their peoples. Twelve years after this lofty commitment, and in spite of improvements in other areas of international concern, it is most regrettable that the situation in southern Africa has not changed.
105.	The colonialist and minority regimes, firmly backed by some NATO powers and international capitalism, continue to suppress African freedom movements savagely, to ignore United Nations resolutions, and to promote subversion against countries which support the freedom movements.
106.	The question of colonialism affects Africa more than any other part of the world, and the continued existence of colonialism in Africa is an infraction of our dignity as Africans and a threat to our national security and sovereignty. That is why we in Africa have had to take a lead in concerting international efforts against colonialism where- ever it exists and in giving substantial material and moral assistance to freedom movements.
107.	To us, therefore, it is a matter of great disappointment that the dedication to the implementation of resolution 1514 (XV) shown by the OAU has not been matched by whole-hearted support of it by some Members of the United Nations, because of their mistaken belief that their national interests would be adversely affected by the total implementation of that resolution. For example, only a few days ago, on Friday, 29 September 1972, we witnessed a deplorable use of the veto by the United Kingdom to thwart the rightful aspirations of the peoples of Zimbabwe to independence and self-determination and to promote the selfish interests of the racist minority regime in that country.
108.	If we are all committed to the liberation of peoples everywhere from the indignity implicit in colonialism and racism, we ought to be prepared to back our verbal commitments with material assistance. In this respect I must express Nigeria's sincere appreciation of the commitment of the foreign ministers of the non-aligned States to increase their material assistance to the liberation movements.
109.	I should also draw attention with great appreciation to the decision of the Foreign Ministers of the Nordic countries to provide material assistance to those liberation movements. These offers of assistance, which positively demonstrate the support for human dignity given by the
Nordic peoples, as well as the non-aligned States, strengthen the determination of the freedom fighters. A tribute must also be paid to the socialist countries for the assistance they have continuously given to the cause of liberation in Africa.
110.	What is required is that assistance be given on such a massive scale as to remove without further delay the forces of oppression and racism from the Territories of Angola, Mozambique, Guinea (Bissau), Zimbabwe and Namibia. For so long as the situation in those Territories remains as it is today so long as the peoples of those Territories are denied the opportunity to exercise their rights to independence and self-determination-there will remain an indelible blot on the record of the United Nations.
111.	Just as disheartening as the lack of progress in decolonization is the continuation of the deplorable policy of apartheid in the Republic of South Africa. In spite of the innumerable resolutions of this Organization, the South African Government has not relented in its pursuit of its racist policy. On the contrary, it has extended that policy more harshly to every aspect of national life in that country. Only recently the Prime Minister of South Africa embarked upon a program designed to cause confusion among black African countries and other mixed societies by advocating dialog with independent black African countries and by increasing facilities for black artists, sportsmen and other personalities to visit South Africa from the United States and similar countries. Even that feeble and insincere concession to world opinion has received a severe set-back through the increasing opposition of the ultra- racist, Fascist wing of his party. The continued failure of the moderate and liberal-minded section of the South African community to secure influential positions in the public life of that country is an indication that no amount of dialog or fraternization will deflect the obscurantist and inflexible advocates of apartheid from their course aimed at the total dehumanization of black people in that country and beyond. For we notice that the South African Government is now exporting apartheid to Zimbabwe, Namibia and the African Territories of Angola and Mozambique, which are still under Portuguese colonial domination.
112.	Afraid that independent African countries north of the Zambezi river might become stable, developed and powerful, and thereby disprove the racist white-superiority concept which underpins the policy of apartheid, and concerned that such countries total abhorrence of the policy of apartheid would increasingly contribute to the overturn of the status quo in South Africa, the South African Government has now mounted a program of action designed to create and promote conspiracies, subversion and sabotage in several independent African countries.
113.	During this session of the General Assembly the United Nations must look closely into areas in which new initiatives can be taken in the efforts to combat apartheid. It is no longer enough to condemn apartheid as being a crime against humanity. It is imperative that we organize more effectively and efficiently our resources to combat this curse to humanity. A start should be made in the more effective and efficient co-ordination of our multifarious activities against apartheid.
114.	I wish to emphasize, as I have on other occasions, the point that Nigeria's policy towards the regimes in southern Africa is not based on racial considerations. It is motivated principally by our firm conviction that all men have the right to freedom and to economic and social justice. Apartheid is to us an abominable and repugnant State policy. If it were imposed on any other race in the world we should condemn it in equally strong terms. Above all our attitude is determined by our awareness that the entrenchment of racialist minority Governments in southern Africa is not only morally wrong but, more importantly, a threat to the sovereignty and security of independent African States and a primary source of international conflict.
115.	The hope for bridging the economic gap between the developed and the developing countries which inspired the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)], has not been borne out. It will be recalled that one of the basic assumptions of the Strategy is the existence in the developed countries of the political will necessary for the implementation of the measures expected of them in the Strategy.
116.	The third session of UNCTAD, held in Santiago, Chile, earlier this year, provided the first opportunity to put to the test the existence or otherwise of this political will on the part of the developed countries. No one who attended that session had any doubt that the bottom had been knocked out of the Strategy. The reluctance of the developed countries to meet even the minimum requirements of the developing countries, as set out in the Declaration adopted at the Second Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 developing countries at Lima on 7 November 1971,  was clearly shown on almost every problem discussed at the session. In the face of this apathy on the part of the advanced countries towards taking the basic step in the implementation of a Strategy which was carefully and elaborately worked out, can we in the third world continue to entrust our economic fortunes to others? It is the view of Nigeria that this situation calls for closer co-operation and deeper consultations among the developing countries to determine what their economic and trade relations with the developed countries should be. To append ourselves to economic units created basically for the development of Europe, for instance, cannot serve the long-term interest of countries on other continents struggling to find their feet. This is why Nigeria is committed to the promotion of regional economic units in Africa which would provide the much-needed co-operation for the rapid development of the continent. The All-Africa Trade Fair held in Nairobi, Kenya, early this year demonstrated the vast potentialities of intra-African trade. But let me hasten to add that Nigeria hopes that the development of regional economic groups will promote, rather than restrict, a free flow of goods and services among all countries.
117.	The issues relating to the law of the sea are bound to assume great proportions during this session of the General Assembly in view of our decision at the twenty-fifth session to convene a conference on the law of the sea in 1973 [resolution 2750 C (XXV)]. Naturally, as a coastal State and as a developing country, Nigeria has a special interest in the proposed conference for two reasons: first is the question of our security; second is the link between the exploitation of the resources of the sea and of the sea-bed and our economic development. Not having participated in the First and Second Conferences on the Law of the Sea, held at Geneva in 1958 and 1960 respectively, Nigeria will want to take this opportunity to ensure that its vital interests are protected even while helping to facilitate international commerce and scientific research for the peaceful exploitation of the sea-bed. It is, therefore, my view that the time spent by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction in preparing an exhaustive list of subjects for discussion at the forthcoming conference on the law of the sea has not been wasted. It is a matter for discussion whether in fact sufficient preparatory work will have been done by the end of this year to enable us to convene the conference as scheduled, if we are to avoid the fiasco of the 1960 Conference. Patience and careful planning are indispensable to achieving our aim of elaborating generally acceptable regimes for the sea.
118.	Just as the Charter of the United Nations is in principle based on the sovereign equality of all its Members, so also must membership in the Security Council and other committees of the United Nations be based on principles which recognize and accommodate ever-changing world attitudes. As the membership of the Organization has increased more than twofold since its inception, it is necessary, in the view of my Government, to readjust the composition of the principal organ concerned with peace and security; for there is no denying the fact that the effectiveness of the Security Council in fulfilling its role cannot be disassociated from its representative character. It is arguable whether or not it is wise in present-day circumstances to continue to maintain a privileged position for those countries which in accordance with Article 23, paragraph 1, of the Charter have permanent seats on the Council and exercise a veto power over its decisions. Basically, the conditions prevalent at the time of the designation of those permanent members no longer apply today, and democratization of our Organization should ideally apply to the Security Council as well. Bearing in mind, however, the present climate of opinion among those permanent members, whose concurrence is necessary for withdrawing their privileges, it may be more realistic to think in terms of the expansion of the system of permanent membership to include representatives from those regions in the world which are at present excluded from permanent membership: for instance, Asia, Africa and Latin America. In any case, Nigeria believes that the need exists for some modest increase in the over-all membership of the Security Council to provide fairer representation of the various geographical regions in our Organization.
119.	The situation in the Middle East continues to be ominous and confused. Various attempts and encouraging movements towards a peaceful solution, or negotiations and contacts with a view to seeking areas of possible accommodation in the interest of peace, continue to be frustrated by the intransigence of some of the parties to the dispute, and their encouragement, for narrow selfish reasons, by some of the big Powers supporting various interests and nations in the area. For us in Nigeria, Security Council resolution 242(1967) still represents the best basis for movement towards settlement and a lasting and just peace in the area.
120.	The initiative taken last year by the OAU, in which my Head of State participated, was to assist in the attainment of this objective. The OAU's inability to record complete success was due, in my opinion, to the legalistic interpretation by the parties of the wording of Security Council resolution 242(1967). May we on this occasion appeal to the parties to take another conciliatory look at that resolution, for it takes full account of the interests of all the parties to this tragic dispute? It is essential that all parties in the area commit themselves to a peaceful settlement.
121.	The issue of terrorism, which has loomed so large during the current session, should be seen in its proper perspective. The unfortunate impression has been created, particularly by the Western press, that Arab and African States are opposed to a discussion of the issue, which, we are told by the supporters of the item [item 92], has created panic in the minds of a section of the international community. Yet, it is now clear, after the preliminary exchange of views, both in the General Committee and in plenary meetings, that the hesitation expressed on the need for a clear definition of the term 'terrorism' in the context in which it is to be discussed is wholly justified. For, if not put in its proper context, the discussion can easily degenerate into a total condemnation of the means of implementing principles which are enshrined in the Charter and have been reiterated in innumerable decisions and resolutions of this Organization.
122.	No responsible Government or person would condone acts perpetrated by individuals against innocent persons for their own personal gain or for emotional satisfaction. However, we are painfully aware that, in pursuance of ideals enshrined in our Charter, it has become necessary for some persons and organizations to adopt violent methods where all avenues of peaceful settlement have been barred. The exercise of self-determination and independence has been recognized by the United Nations as the inalienable right of all peoples. Yet we see these rights being denied to millions of people in southern Africa by the reign of terror imposed on them by colonialist and racialist regimes. If such peoples resort to armed force, Nigeria cannot be party to a discussion that will seek to equate their activities with those of common criminals who hijack planes and kidnap diplomats and other important people to extort financial benefits for themselves. Certainly, we in Africa, who have endured the most vicious forms of terrorism, have no inhibition in exposing to the world what some of our brothers still suffer. What we cannot condone is to give those who organize the worst forms of terror an opportunity to condemn as terrorists the victims of their inhumanity. It must be made clear that peoples struggling to liberate themselves from oppression and exploitation have the right to use all methods at their disposal, including force. This fact has been recognized by our Organization. We should therefore not leave the door wide open for reactionary regimes to erode the glorious struggles of these peoples. In this regard we hope that the Sixth Committee, to which the item has now been referred, will give a clear definition that will be generally acceptable to Members of this Organization.
123.	I wish to conclude this statement by affirming our abiding faith in the ability of the United Nations to contribute to the consolidation of peace among all nations, to the enhancement of justice in all lands and to the promotion of the economic and social progress of all the peoples of the world. We, in Nigeria, shall continue to do all that we can to contribute to the improvement of the methods of the United Nations, in the hope that the Organization will decide to proceed with greater vigor to tackle its unfinished business: to assert the dignity of the human being and his right to self-determination and the enjoyment of freedom, to press forward the elimination of apartheid, to bring about the elimination of force as an instrument for settling disputes, and to concert international co-operation for the furtherance of the economic and social progress of peoples everywhere. This, we believe, will enhance the possibilities of the United Nations to flourish for the good of mankind.

1973

2.	 I am particularly delighted with the opportunity to address this Assembly. This is my first visit here in this capacity and already I feel that I am among friends. This is as it should be. For we are all united by our desire to translate into reality the philosophy behind the founding of this world body. It was the hope of the founding fathers that this Organization, representing peoples of different political, cultural, economic and social backgrounds, should be an effective instrument for harmonizing different views, reconciling competing interests and concerting such action as would give substance to mankind's aspirations for peace and plenty in justice and dignity. Ideals nobler than these for structuring a world order will definitely be difficult to find. To live up to such high expectations is the great challenge before all of us who are assembled here.
3.	Permit me, Mr. President, to convey to you my heartiest congratulations on your election as President of this twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. It is a fitting tribute to your sterling qualities as a diplomat who has rendered distinguished services not only to your country, but also to the international community as a whole. Your election is also a well-deserved honour for your country,
Ecuador, with which my country enjoys warm relations, and which has shown consistent adherence to the principles and purposes of our Charter. I have no doubt that under your wise guidance this session of the General Assembly will achieve great success.
4.	My congratulations also go to the members of your Bureau and to the distinguished Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, who, since his assumption of office, has brought great dedication and sense of personal commitment to his heavy task. I wish him continued success and God's blessing. I wish also to place formally on record my appreciation of the excellent services rendered to this Organization and humanity by the past Secretaries-General, particularly the late Dag Hammarskjold and U Thant.
5.	Thirteen years ago my country was admitted as the ninety-ninth Member of this Organization. On that occasion, the then Prime Minister of Nigeria, the late Sir Abu-bakar Tafawa Balewa, expressed the belief of Nigeria in the United Nations as the only effective machinery for bringing about world peace and the progress of mankind generally. Today, I wish to reaffirm my country's faith in the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. We in Nigeria believe that if all Members States adhere strictly to the provisions of our Charter, as an earnest of their dedication to the ideals of our Organization, then we may yet accomplish that unique and bright promise for all mankind which the United Nations represents.
6.	I am a strong believer in the United Nations. I therefore find it rather disturbing that the image which some people tend to have of the United Nations is a misleading one of lack of dramatic success in dealing immediately with some of the major problems of peace and security, of human rights, and the degrading poverty of a large majority of the world's population. Proceeding from such a viewpoint, the conclusion is often heard that this Organization is hardly any more relevant to our times. I do not share such pessimism, and I venture to suggest that most Africans would not accept such a doleful assessment of the United Nations. We are all well aware of its shortcomings and its failings. These are, in some measure, a reflection of the world which produced and now operates the Organization. It is necessary to seek to improve its effectiveness, but we in Africa hope that the States Members of the United Nations will embark on such a process in a manner that would not do damage to this Organization which is so vital to the vast underprivileged, as yet developing, population of the third world. 

7.	For millions of such peoples throughout the world, the United Nations provides an indispensable forum for bringing to world attention, some of the problems that plague the world, and for which, all too often, no other means of solution are apparent. The United Nations can and does bring to bear the moral weight of world opinion on many a controversial issue. That explains its great value to the smaller nations and to the dispossessed and downtrodden peoples of the world. For example, it is clear that without the moral pressure exerted on colonial Powers, principally by this Organization, the struggle for self-determination and independence would definitely have been more difficult for many of the nations that are today proud Members of the United Nations. Nor can we ignore the invaluable services rendered by the Organization and its specialized agencies in the vital areas of health, literacy campaigns, child welfare and the championship of progressive labour legislation on a world-wide basis.
8.	It cannot be over-emphasized that the primary purpose of the United Nations is 'to save mankind from the scourge of war'. Unfortunately, we have not always attained this lofty objective. There have been breaches of peace, such as in Korea, and Viet-Nam, with consequences no less dismal and harrowing for those affected. However, since 1945, there has been no global war such as mankind experienced to its horror during the first half of this century. It is to the credit of this Organization that, even when conflicts do occur between nations in recent times, peaceful intervention by the United Nations has succeeded in arresting them. In other areas of the world, the United Nations continues to play a key and vital role in providing physical stability and preventing a deterioration of unhappy and unstable political and social conditions. It is, therefore, not unjustified that we should look back on the 28 years of the existence of this Organization with some degree of satisfaction. The little measure of stability and hope that the world and its many peoples have been given these past 28 years has been worthy of the long hours spent in this hall as well as in the chambers of the Security Council and other organs of the United Nations.
9.	Of course, to acknowledge these areas of achievement of the United Nations should by no means lull us into a sense of complacency. As in every human organization, there are areas of United Nations activities that cry out for urgent attention and improvement. Among these is the imperative need to correct the structural and institutional deficiencies that hamstring some of its operations. When the Charter was framed, five nations were entrusted with the responsibility of 'policing' the whole world. In the prevailing circumstances of those days such an arrangement might have been justifiable and acceptable. It is no longer so today. An urgent review of the decision-making processes in the United Nations system, taking into full account existing political realities, is long overdue. I need hardly say that one area of immediate concern is the increasing use of the veto in the Security Council in support of causes which seem to be in conflict with the noble objectives of the Charter. In this connexion, it must be emphasized that African nations, and indeed most nations of the world, have been distressed at the constant use of the veto to block meaningful initiatives in matters relating to fundamental human rights, freedom and human dignity in many areas of the world and, in particular, in parts of Africa still under foreign or minority regimes. It is our hope, therefore, that the nations which at present enjoy the privileges of veto power should use it responsibly in furtherance of world peace and the progress of mankind.
10.	The Secretary-General has, in the introduction to his latest report on the work of the Organization, invited us to participate in a 'constructive debate' about the future of this Organization [A/9001/Add. 1, p.l]. It is my hope that in responding to this invitation all Member States would advance proposals that would ensure that the resolutions and decisions of the United Nations are implemented by all Member States.
11.	It is a matter for great relief that in the world today preoccupation with outmoded rivalries and enmities on the one hand, and ideological distrusts and suspicions on the other is now being progressively replaced by the spirit of accommodation. The admission of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic into the United Nations justifies the expectation that before long there will be genuine universality of representation in this Organization. I congratulate them, as well as the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, on their admission.
12.	While commending the important steps towards ending the legacies of the Second World War in Europe, we must state that steps towards normalization of the situation in that continent should be matched by the continuing search for peace, understanding and co-operation throughout the world. The search for peace and security must be in a global context and must involve the active participation of all countries. We welcome agreements between the superpowers inasmuch as these agreements lessen the fear and threat of nuclear warfare. However, we are compelled to call on the super-Powers to resist the temptation of limiting their negotiating spirit only to such issues as are of narrow interest to them and their people. We must insist that their negotiations and agreements which affect the fate of others should take account of the views of those concerned. For every nation and every country, great or small, rich or poor, has a stake in peace and security. It is therefore essential that each should participate, on the basis of sovereign equality, in resolving issues of concern to the whole world.
13.	A few months ago the Organization of African Unity [OA U\ celebrated its tenth anniversary. I had the great privilege of presiding over the ceremonies and the tenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU. I should like to express the deep appreciation of OAU and all the people of Africa to the United Nations for the co-operation, inspiration and assistance that have continued to characterize the relations between our regional organization and this world body. We highly appreciate the constant interest of the United Nations as an institution, and the unfailing concern of the Secretary-General and the various agencies in developments in Africa and the progress of OAU. All this is in keeping with the spirit of Article 52, which encourages regional organizations 'consistent with the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations'.
14.	The Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights contributed significantly to the basis and the charter of OAU. Permit me, therefore, to make some observations about how our regional organization has been addressing itself to the many problems confronting our continent.
15.	The birth of OAU in 1963 was a great act of faith, and its response to the challenges of modern times has filled all Africans with joy and immense pride. After only 10 years we have overcome some of the earlier impediments and difficulties in our way. Independent countries from all parts of Africa, with a variety of historical, political, linguistic and social backgrounds, are now united in our organization, which has come to be recognized as the voice of our continent.
16.	Of course, when we reviewed the various activities of OAU at that meeting we acknowledged that we had not achieved all our objectives. Indeed, it would have been difficult to achieve every single one of our aims and objectives in a short decade, given the uncertainties and unforeseen contingencies of world events. However, we have succeeded in consolidating our national independence, and in settling among ourselves and without distracting attention from outside Africa, many such intra-African disputes that have arisen. We have launched many economic and social programmes for improving the quality of life of our peoples in a spirit of self-reliance.
17.	We have brought the meaning of African unity and co-operation much nearer to each African's heart. We have continued to uphold, as central to the problems of our continent, the spirit of self-sacrifice, of compromise, and of reconciliation. We have pledged to redouble our efforts with a view to eradicating all forms of colonialism and racism from our continent, and thus assume control of our continent's destiny. Above all, OAU has symbolized the collective effort of the Governments of Africa and their peoples to uphold for ever the dignity and stature of the African in this world.
18.	The problem posed by the continuation of colonialism, racism and apartheid is the most intractable problem that has confronted us on the continent. Not only do colonialism, racism and apartheid constitute an unbearable affront on human dignity in the areas where those evils exist; they represent a great threat to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of independent African States and to international peace and security. Thirteen years after the adoption of United Nations resolution 1514 (XV) on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples, more than 30 million Africans, spread over about one-sixth of our continent, continue to be denied their human rights, exploited and subjugated under minority, racist and colonial regimes. In defiance of world public opinion and in contemptuous disregard of the decisions of all international organizations of African unity, those regimes have fanatically frustrated and resisted all attempts at introducing constitutional changes designed to involve, in simple justice, the majority of the inhabitants of those lands in the processes that govern their destiny and their daily lives. Thus denied constantly of their basic and legitimate rights, and bereft of all hope of change by an impervious and inflexible ruling class, is it any wonder that the voice of despair is turning reasonable men who desire nothing but peace and progress to their frightful alternatives offered by constant frustration and loss of hope? Can we wonder then that the people are attracted, in such a situation, to the painful alternative of force and conflict? For our part in OAU we have no choice but to give whole-hearted support to the efforts of our unfortunate brothers to restore their legitimate right to self-determination and independence. In the words of the Solemn Declaration on General Policy adopted at our tenth anniversary session:
'... our support for the liberation struggle was adopted in response to the legitimate and profound aspirations of our peoples and should be viewed less as a circumstantial community of interests than as an awareness of the common destiny of all peoples of the African continent'.
19.	At the same meeting, the African Heads of State and Government viewed with satisfaction the progress made in the decade since the establishment of OAU in the legitimate struggle of the peoples of Angola, Guinea-Bissau and the Cape Verde Islands, Mozambique, Namibia, Zimbabwe, the Comoro Islands, the so-called French Somaliland, the so-called Spanish Sahara, the Seychelles Islands and the islands of Sao Tome and Principe. The struggle and the pressure will continue in Africa until the stain of this degradation of human dignity has been removed and until the African, everywhere on his continent, can raise his head proudly in independence and self-determination and thereby be able to contribute his quota to world progress.
20.	In this regard, Mr. President, let me commend to you and to members of this honourable Assembly the bold and momentous step taken by the long-oppressed people of Guinea-Bissau and their political party in declaring their country independent. We in Africa believe that the struggle for final consolidation of the independence of this new nation will be much assisted by the practical support and co-operation which all men of goodwill and all who subscribe to the principles of the Charter of this Organization will extend, promptly and without hesitation, to the efforts of the rightful owners and peoples of Guinea-Bissau.
21.	The declaration of independence by the people of Guinea-Bissau has received the overwhelming support of member States of OAU and of the friends of Africa. I should like, on behalf of Africa, to thank those friends for their prompt recognition accorded to that new State. It is our hope, therefore, that that new nation will shortly take its rightful position as a proud member of the international community.
22.	What of the special case of Namibia? The situation in Namibia continues to be a source of considerable embarrassment and concern to this Organization. I do not need to go over the various steps that have been taken by the United Nations and its competent organs to bring some rational solution to the situation created in Namibia by the intransigence of the racist regime of South Africa which still occupies that country illegally. The United Nations has endeavoured to carry out its fundamental responsibilities to the hapless people of Namibia by repeatedly providing opportunities for a progressive and peaceful transformation of the situation in the country. It was the hope of many people in different parts of the world that the South African Government would, in its own wider interests, take advantage of the opportunities offered by the United Nations to fulfil its woefully neglected obligations to the people of Namibia.
23.	But what have we found? The South African Government is intent upon defying the opinions of the world. Even after the International Court of Justice has expressed opinions which clearly indicated that the South African Government had no further moral or legal right to dominate Namibia, the South African Government continues to subject the people of that country to its Fascist social and political system.
24.	One is entitled to ask why it is that of all the Territories that were entrusted to the colonialist Powers under the Trusteeship System, only in Namibia, the Territory entrusted to South Africa, has this international trust been betrayed. All the Territories are today full Members of the United Nations or on their way to independence. We in Africa strongly believe that the United Nations and particularly the permanent members of the Security Council have a duty and responsibility to use all means at their disposal to compel South Africa to withdraw from Namibia and thereafter to assume control of the Territory and to administer it until it attains full independence.
25.	Side by side with the steady pressure and progress in the efforts of the liberation movements in various parts of Africa, we witness with dismay the support that continues to be rendered by some nations to two Member States of this Organization that have the dubious distinction in history of being the sole advocates of repression and colonialism and racism. Also, the illegal regime in Salisbury still continues because of the non-compliance by certain Member countries of this Organization with the unanimous decisions of the Organization and of mankind. Perhaps those who prefer to sell a few goods to such an illegal clique, or to buy such commodities as the racists of Salisbury wish to sell in order to maintain themselves in power, have made their own calculations and prefer their temporary material profit to their sense of honour and their position in history.
26.	While on this subject, perhaps I should emphasize again the sadness of Africa in the face of the stubborn and unreasonable intransigence of those white regimes that continue to constitute themselves as enemies of Africa and of the third world. Nobody in Africa wishes to adopt the path of armed struggle and conflict against those minority regimes for the love of it. Nobody has asked that people who normally live in Africa and wish to consider themselves as part of Africa should, by any manner or means, be made to feel unwelcome. Those who are born among us and live and join us both in spirit and co-operation are welcome to live in Africa. For they are Africans. It is for this reason that we made genuine efforts to assure the world of our desire for. racial harmony on conditions of mutual respect and fundamental human rights of all the inhabitants of the continent. Is that not a message of hope for the colonialist and racist regimes? The Lusaka Manifesto  which was presented to this Assembly three years ago by my dear friend and brother, President Ahmadou Ahidjo of the United Republic of Cameroon on behalf of Africa,  embodied Africa's effort to work out a peaceful solution to the colonial and racial problems of the continent — problems which are not of our own making. What was the response? The colonialist and racist regimes rejected out of hand our peace offer and rewarded us with intensification of repressive laws in the areas under their control, massacres of our people, inspired assassination of the authentic leaders of the African freedom movements, and attacks on independent African countries.
27.	Viewed, therefore, against the background of our efforts to initiate peaceful solutions, and the response we got, we are bewildered that several countries which claim to be friends of Africa continue to give such material and moral support to the colonialist and racist regimes, and to strengthen them in their oppression of our peoples. Permit me to appeal again on behalf of Africa to those who give support to our oppressors. It is time for all of us Members of the United Nations to join hands in an effective and total isolation of the colonial and racist regimes in southern Africa. It is time for us to tighten sanctions against the rebel clique in Salisbury. In addition, I appeal to the United Nations and the international community generally, to extend to the liberation movements and to the millions of Africans under severe oppression and exploitation, such material assistance as would ensure fulfilment to the African peoples of the promise held out by the Charter of the United Nations.
28.	Time is on the side of the African in the struggle against colonialism and apartheid. Victory is sure to be ours in the war against oppression and deprivation of individual liberty. But the United Nations and its Member countries can render the process less painful and can help to make the road shorter by taking necessary steps before it is too late. By so doing, they would be contributing to the increase of peace and progress, in place of unhappiness and pain and suffering in the world.
29.	During our tenth anniversary session, the African Heads of State and Government adopted another document of considerable importance. I refer to the African Declaration on Co-operation, Development and Economic Independence. In the 10 years since OAU was founded, we have observed that the promise of substantial economic development, leading to the path of economic independence, as contained in the charter of OAU, has not been marked by encouraging progress. On the contrary, the pattern has been one of continuing deterioration in the economic and social conditions of African and developing countries generally. The gap between us and the developed countries continues to grow even wider. Measures adopted during the last decade, we found, have been frustrated by other developments in the world at large, over which we have little say and no control. The terms of trade have constantly gone against us. World monetary arrangements have been made without consultations with us and without adequate consideration of our interests.
30.	Faced with this situation and firmly convinced that our economic destiny must be taken firmly in our own hands if noticeable improvement is to be achieved, African States solemnly proclaimed their determination to achieve the economic independence and development of the continent through the effective mobilization of Africa's own human and material resources. To this end, we decided to accelerate the implementation of the Africanization policy in each of our countries and to ensure effective and equitable African representation in international organizations.
31.	Bearing in mind the loss which Africa has suffered and continues to sustain through the foreign exploitation of its natural resources, we resolved to defend vigorously, continually and jointly, the sovereign rights of our countries to exercise full and effective control over our resources.
32.	We believe that the time has come for the rich in this Organization to ponder seriously on the danger of being surrounded by so many poor. In their own self interest, if not for the sake of humanity in general, the rich nations should at least give us an even chance of pulling ourselves up. It is no longer our intention to go cap in hand to the door of the rich. What we want and demand is the opportunity for our own people to be afforded a chance of acquiring those skills and those elements of technology without which no decent and progressive economic system can be structured and maintained in the modern world. We have learned that we cannot expect help, at least not of the order that would make a significant contribution to our own needs of development. But the older, more experienced and more technologically advanced countries can still do much to redeem the pledge they made to humanity and to this Organization by not putting impediments in our way, by making less selfish and lopsided marketing arrangements for our own produce and by facilitating our determination to utilize such resources as we have in the interest of our own peoples. I hope that this session of the General Assembly will approve a constructive idea which emerged from the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Algiers from 5 to 9 September 1973, namely, that a special session of the General Assembly devoted to economic matters should be held in 1975, when we shall be half way through the Second United Nations Development Decade.
33.	I shall conclude my address by referring to the urgent and serious problem of the Middle East, an area with which Africa enjoys strong and deep ties.
34.	As if the situation whereby about 2 million hapless refugees have been dispossessed of their homelands and virtually condemned to live out their lives in tents was not bad enough, the conditions of 'no war, no peace' compound the problem. Since June 1967 parts of the territories of States Members of our Organization have remained under foreign occupation by another State Member of the United Nations. When the Security Council adopted its famous resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967, it was widely accepted that the provisions of that resolution formed a balanced framework for an equitable and honourable solution to the crisis. It was the greatest hope for peace based on justice in that region. Not only has peace proved elusive; we are all witnesses to the unspeakable series of aggressions, heartless and mindless brutalities, harassments and massacres, not to speak of air piracies and hijackings, which dominate the news from the area. Needless to say, such conditions are a constant threat to world peace and security.
35.	OAU has, in session after session, expressed great concern at the situation. We did even more. As will be recalled, in 1971 a mission of four African Heads of State paid a visit to Egypt and Israel. It was a great honour and privilege for me to have been a member of that mission. Our objective was to see how best OAU, since one of its member nations was involved in the Middle East conflict, could contribute, even if in small measure, to the efforts of the United Nations and others towards a just and peaceful solution or, at any rate, the reduction of the tension of the explosive situation.
36.	During its tenth session, held in Addis Ababa-last May, OAU once again reviewed the seemingly intractable situation in the Middle East. It adopted a resolution and charged me, as its current Chairman, with the task of presenting its views to this Assembly.
37.	Permit me, therefore, to read out the resolution which was unanimously adopted by the Assembly of African Heads of State and Government:
'The OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government, meeting in its Tenth Ordinary Session in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from 27 to 29 May 1973,
'Having heard the statement of His Excellency El Shafei, Vice-President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, on the situation in the Middle East in general, and in particular on that resulting from the continued occupation of part of the territory of Egypt since the Israeli aggression of 5 June 1967,
'Recalling all OAU resolutions adopted in this respect, and especially resolution AHG/Res.67 (IX) of the Rabat Summit Conference,
'Reaffirming resolution 2949 (XXVII) of the United Nations General Assembly, passed in December 1972,
'Aware of the danger emanating from the deterioration of the situation in the North-East of Africa as a result of the continued aggression perpetrated against the territory of Egypt and other Arab territories — a danger which threatens the security, territorial integrity and unity of our continent,
'Noting with deep concern that despite the numerous resolutions of the OAU and the United Nations calling upon it to withdraw from all occupied African and Arab territories, Israel not only persists in refusing to implement resolutions, but also continues to practise a policy with a view to creating in the said territories a state of fait accompli aimed at serving its expansionist designs,
'Deploring the systematic obstruction by Israel of all the efforts exerted to reach a peaceful solution to the problem at both the international and African levels,
'Recalling in this respect the negative attitude of Israel towards the mission of the ten African Heads of State mandated by the OAU to work for the implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967, which stipulated in particular withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the occupied territories, in conformity with the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territories by force,
'Noting with satisfaction that the Arab Republic of Egypt has spared no effort to reach a just and durable solution of the problem, and that these efforts have been
characterized by the constructive co-operation of Egypt with international as well as African forums,
'Noting further that the intransigence of Israel and its systematic refusal to abide by the will of the international community constitutes a threat to the security of the continent,
'Fully aware that the massive military, economic and other aid as well as the political and moral support granted to Israel by certain Powers enable it to pursue its aggression and encourage it to commit acts of terrorism, especially the tragic act of shooting down the Libyan civilian aircraft, which resulted in the loss of innocent lives,
'1. Takes note of the statement of His Excellency H. El Shafei, Vice-President of the Arab Republic of Egypt;
'2. Strongly condemns the negative attitude of Israel, its acts of terrorism and its obstruction of all efforts aimed at a just and equitable solution of the problem in accordance with Security Council resolution 242 (1967) c* 22 November 1967;
'3. Calls once more for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from all occupied African and Arab territories;
'4. Declares that all changes effected by Israel in the occupied territories are null and void, and pledges not to recognize any changes leading to a fait accompli or likely to jeopardize the territorial integrity of the countries which are victims of the Israeli aggression;
'5. Recognizes that the respect of the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine is an essential element in any just and equitable solution, besides being an indispensable factor for the establishment of permanent peace in the region;
'6. Reaffirms in the name of African solidarity and by virtue of article II, paragraph 1 (c) of the OAU Charter its active and total support for the Arab Republic of Egypt in its legitimate struggle to recover entirely and by all means its territorial integrity;
'7. Draws the attention of Israel to the danger threatening the security and unity of the African continent as a result of its continued aggression and refusal to evacuate the territories of the States victims of that aggression and declares that the attitude of Israel might lead OAU member States to take, at the African level, individually or collectively, political and economic measures against it, in conformity with the principles contained in the OAU and United Nations Charters;
'8. Earnestly calls upon the big Powers supplying Israel with arms and military equipment of all kinds and granting it moral and political support that enables it to strengthen its military potential to refrain from doing so;
'9. Strongly supports the Egyptian initiative requesting the United Nations Secretary-General to report to the Security Council on the explosive situation prevailing in the Middle East, and expresses the hope that the Security Council shall take every appropriate measure to implement immediately the relevant resolutions adopted by the United Nations, so that a just and durable peace may be established in the region;
'10. Designates the Foreign Ministers of Nigeria, Chad, Tanzania, Guinea, Algeria, Kenya and the Sudan to be the spokesmen of the OAU on this matter at the Security Council of the United Nations on 4 and 5 June
1973;
'11. Entrusts the current Chairman of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government to present the views of the OAU on the matter at the next session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.'
There is the unanimous voice of Africa on this issue.
38.	Since then, the six Foreign Ministers designated by the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government have participated in the Security Council meetings that were specifically convened at the instance of Egypt.  The debate that ensued, though extensive, produced no results that could bring peace nearer to that region. OAU cannot condone a situation whose final determination can be decided only by the force of arms. We regard it as an intolerable provocation that part of Egypt, a member State, should continue to remain under armed occupation in spite of the unanimous expressions of international opinion against the acquisition of territory by force of arms.
39.	Members of OAU desire peace in the Middle East —  peace based on equity; peace that does not insist on acquisition of other people's territory as a pre-condition; peace that acknowledges the right of all nations in the area to exist in security; peace that places a premium on respect for cultural diversity; peace that upholds the dignity of man and draws sustenance from the principles enunciated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Charter of the United Nations. For all the inhabitants of the area have every right to expect that they should no longer be distracted from the urgent tasks of economic reconstruction and social development. They have every right to live in peace and to continue to contribute, as they have done in the past and in history, to the mainstream of human civilization. That is the Middle East that the people of Africa envisage and fervently desire to see.
40.	This is my message. This is the solemn assignment entrusted to me by OAU.
















1974

On behalf of the Nigerian delegation, I congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Your election is an appropriate recognition of your personal qualities as a statesman, an international diplomat and a fighter for human dignity. More importantly, your election symbolizes international recognition of the role of Algeria and its respected President, Houari Boumediene, in the struggle for equality, the right to self-determination and human dignity. It is a fortunate coincidence that you should be presiding over this crucial session, which will be faced with taking follow-up action on the decisions of the sixth special session, held as a result of the initiative of the President of your great country.
2.	This session, which was devoted exclusively to the question of raw materials and development, was the culmination of a universal concern for the disastrous prospects of the existing international economic order. At that session resolution 3201 (S-VI) was adopted, which spoke of our united determination to work urgently for the establishment of a new international economic order based on equity, sovereign equality, interdependence, common interest and co-operation among all States.
3.	In that resolution we accepted then that the developing countries, which constitute 70 per cent of the world's population, account for only 30 per cent of the world's income. We declared that in order to safeguard every country's natural resources, each State is entitled to exercise effective control over them and their exploitation and that no State may be subjected to economic, political or any other type of coercion to prevent the free and full exercise of this inalienable right.
4.	The Assembly also pronounced itself on the need to regulate and supervise the activities of transnational corporations by taking measures in the interest of the national economies of the countries where such transnational corporations operate, on the basis of the full sovereignty of those countries; and finally, among other matters, the Assembly declared itself in favor of a just and equitable relationship between the prices of raw materials, primary commodities, and manufactured goods exported by developing countries and the prices of raw materials, primary commodities, manufactured goods, capital goods and imported equipment, with the aim of bringing about sustained improvement in the unsatisfactory terms of trade and the expansion of the world economy.
5.	This resolution was adopted on 1 May 1974 as the basis for the establishment of a new international economic order. But only six months later, some of the countries which participated in the adoption of that resolution want to jettison the historic Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order which it contains.
6.	One primary commodity -crude oil- has been singled out and made the villain of the piece; and the oil-producing countries are being pilloried before the bar of this Assembly as the culprits of international inflation and the wreckers of the national economies of the great wealthy nations. There is even talk of bringing back the gunboat to get oil prices reduced. Is it not sad that the international community continues to use nineteenth-century methods to solve late- twentieth-century international problems?
7.	Of course, the price of oil has increased sevenfold, but even more so have the prices of wheat, automobiles, steel, cement, every type of machinery and every piece of electronic equipment. Stated bluntly, the argument of those who say that if only oil prices were reduced then inflation would be checked means that the highly industrialized countries are not prepared to make any sacrifice in the phenomenally high standard of living of their peoples in order to promote the development of the developing countries and ensure the adequate flow of real resources to those countries.
8.	It is true that the non-oil-producing developing countries are the least able to pay the foreign exchange bill demanded by high oil prices; but that is precisely the reason why there has been so much consultation in recent months between countries of the third world for the purpose of working out mutual assistance agreements and the establishment of special facilities to assist the most hard-hit countries. That is the reason why oil-producing countries, like my own, in spite of their development needs, are responding to international appeals for multilateral assistance to the hardest hit. 
9.	In the sixth special session the Assembly recognized the role of transnational corporations in the fashioning of a new international economic order. The Nigerian delegation had hoped that at this session proposals would be brought forward for the reform of the policies and practices of transnational corporations to enable them to conform and assist in promoting the new international economic order. If we take that most abused commodity, crude oil, we know that transnational corporations, which control the oil industry, hold national governments to ransom on oil prices. It is common knowledge that for every dollar which the producer country earns, the international oil companies earn between 7 and 10 dollars. National governments seem incapable of controlling, in the interest of their citizens, the profits made by oil companies operating in their countries. Is this not a problem which requires international co-operation within the United Nations system for its solution?
10.	Next, I must ask how we are going to establish a just and equitable relationship between the prices of raw materials, primary products and manufactured goods if we cannot 'set our sights' above the current price of oil. It is my delegation's hope that the Assembly at this session will devote a considerable part of its effort to working out the implementation of the two resolutions adopted at the sixth special session, for, in the words of the Secretary-General in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization:
'There can be no doubt that the nature and quality of life for future generations on this planet depends, as never before, on the ability of the community of nations to co-operate and plan effectively for the future in the common interest of all' [Al960llAdd.l, sect. /].
11.	The full impact of the special session at which the Assembly sought to put world economic relation-ships in their proper perspective will take many years to unfold, but I want to assure you even now that the Nigerian Government takes very seriously the solemn resolve of Members of the United Nations to work for the establishment of a new international economic order. The Program of Action adopted at the special session [resolution 3202 (S-VI)] outlined what is to be done in order to bring about that new order. It calls on the international community to replace an outmoded and lopsided structure of international economic relations with one based on full recognition of mutual interdependence and respect for the mutual interests of all parties. To do this, we must possess the political wisdom to recognize the need for change in our mental attitudes so that those who hitherto have been used to having every issue settled on their own terms can become accustomed to recognizing the legitimate aspirations of others. Inflation and supply shortages are real problems which we must deal with co-operatively and in a spirit of realism and mutual understanding, bearing in mind that we are living in a period of change, and that a period of change is sometimes accompanied by inconveniences to which we must learn to adjust. We must tackle these inconveniences through co-operation, not through confrontation.
12.	Nowhere has the period of change manifested itself more clearly than on the continent of Africa, over the past year. About this time last year the people of Guinea-Bissau, through their, authentic representatives, the Partido Africano da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde [PAIGC], took their fate in their own hands and declared their independence. We are happy that today the Republic of Guinea-Bissau is a proud Member of the United Nations, thus fulfilling the prophetic message which my head of State, General Yakubu Gowon, sent to the Heads of State of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] in 1971, namely, that within three years from that date at least one African Territory must be liberated from colonial bondage. The spirit of? liberation has gathered far more momentum than was anticipated in 1971, and we are happy to note the change in Mozambique, which has resulted in the installation in that country of a government of nationalists, poised to assume full sovereignty in 1975. We pray that the efforts towards conciliation which are now going on in Angola will result in the assumption of full sovereignty by that potentially great country before long. The Government and people of Nigeria congratulate the liberation movements of these countries on their sacrifices and their achievements. I should also like to place on record my Government's appreciation of the courage and wisdom of the masses of the Portuguese people in realizing that their long-lost freedom was inexorably bound up with the freedom of the peoples of southern Africa, who for 50 years had been the victims of political domination by a neo-Fascist clique from Portugal. I should also congratulate the new Portuguese Government for giving firm support to the new Mozambique Government in crushing the futile white minority coup in that country. One hopes that the lesson of the Portuguese Government's action will not be lost on their oldest allies, who continue to equivocate on Rhodesia.
13.	These developments in Portuguese-held territories must give this Organization tremendous satisfaction. The support which the United Nations gave to Africa and the national liberation movements was indispensable for the final liquidation of Portuguese imperialism in Africa. However, vigilance is still required to ensure that the few reactionary elements in both Portugal and Angola and Mozambique are not permitted to reverse or even slow down the process of Portuguese decolonization.
14.	Regrettably, Namibia still remains in the fetters of South Africa's illegal occupation. The well-organized brutalities practiced on the indigenous population of Namibia in the hope of destroying their fight for freedom can be matched only by the Nazi horrors of the first half of this century. For how long will the United Nations watch such horrors helplessly? For how long will the Organization shy away from the firm measures that are needed to assert United Nations authority over Namibia? I do not believe that anyone here is still in doubt as to the unwillingness of the Vorster regime to withdraw gracefully from Namibia. Unless, therefore, this Organization is prepared to acquiesce in the illegal seizure of Namibia by South Africa, prompt and decisive action should be taken now to end South Africa's continuing defiance of the authority of the United Nations over Namibia. As in Namibia so in Zimbabwe; time is running out for the minority white oligarchies. One must pray that the white minorities in both Territories will choose the alternative of co-operation in a multiracial society before the deluge.
15.	Before ending my remarks on decolonization, I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the two other new Members of the Organization on their accession to membership and to the Charter. I refer, of course, to the People's Republic of Bangladesh and Grenada, both of which share membership of yet another organization with my country. Let me assure them that both in this and in every other forum my country will work in co-operation with -them for the achievement of international understanding and co-operation.
16.	The brief interlude of comparative calm in the Middle East since the cease-fire after the October 1973 battle has created the impression that the Middle East conflict can now be resolved by a meeting in Geneva between the big Powers and the adversaries, and that we, the small countries of the world, need play no role beyond that of cheer-leaders in the power game called the Middle East crisis. If doing nothing more than cheering the players could bring real peace in that area and, by implication, peace of mind to the peoples of the African region, my country would be happy to do just that and no more. Unfortunately, this attitude is based on a fallacy. That is why my delegation welcomes the inclusion in our agenda for this session of the question of Palestine [item 108], and the opportunity of a full debate on what the international community understand by the phrase 'Reaffirms the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine' contained in General Assembly resolution 2535 B (XXIV) of 10 December 1969. Furthermore, the General Assembly ought to state what is meant by returning to the Arabs 'the lands occupied by Israel as a result of the 6 June 1967 war, as stated in Security Council resolution 242 (1967).
17.	One would have thought that these phrases would mean what they say. However, they have been subject to such varying interpretations that, unless agreement is reached by the parties on what resolution 242 (1967) means, months of meetings in Geneva will not bring the solution of the Middle East crisis any nearer. We should have no illusions about any solution which does not take into account the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Arab people on the one hand and the recognition that Israel is a reality, a nation which can make its own contributions to world peace, on the other. As for the Palestinians, the international community cannot continue indefinitely to acquiesce in their remaining permanent refugees. Four million people rendered homeless as a result of the struggle in their land cannot be allowed to continue to live without purpose and without hope. These are the issues which must be settled in Geneva. These are the issues on which this Assembly must pronounce, as guidance for those who sit round the conference table in Geneva.
18.	Reference to the situation in the Middle East cannot but draw attention to that unhappy island State, Cyprus. Whatever may be the rights and wrongs of the parties to the tragic drama in that island, we in Nigeria are convinced that Cyprus must be enabled to continue as one undivided sovereign State, and that the citizens of the sovereign State of Cyprus must learn to live together under one sovereign government. What arrangement the peoples of Cyprus make to ensure the stability and territorial integrity of their country is a matter of their internal affairs. My delegation hopes that the United Nations will lend its authority to ensuring the independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus.
19.	The events of the past 12 months, whether political or economic, indicate more than ever before that at no other time in the history of mankind has the term 'village' applied more appropriately to the world. It needs little perception, therefore, to recognize that this 'village' world of ours has become too small for endless rampages. Peace in the world is as indivisible as its destiny. We live in challenging times, which equally offer us more opportunities to meet these challenges. Despite its weaknesses, the United Nations is one of man's greatest creations. It offers us a unique forum for sustaining universal peace and progress. Let all its Member States, there-fore, powerful and weak alike, exercise the political self-discipline necessary for them to adapt the Organization and its rules to meet their present-day needs.
20.	I would like to end this statement with a tribute to the Secretary-General, whose courage and sense of mission have averted disaster after disaster in the past 12 months, whether in the Middle East, the Sahelian region, southern Africa or Cyprus.
21.	May I add as a postscript my country' s sympathy for the victims of the disasters in Honduras and Peru.

110.	 It is with great pleasure that I convey to the President the congratulations of the Nigerian delegation on his election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. He represents a country and a region which have tremendous potential for the advancement of the ideals of the Charter of our Organization and for the realization of the aspirations of the underprivileged section of mankind. His well known personal commitment to the cause of peace and the uplifting of human dignity encourages me to hope that, under his wise guidance, this session will achieve significant success. In this endeavor, I assure him of the co-operation of my delegation.
111.	The relevance of the United Nations to the solution of the urgent problems of today is no longer in doubt. In the period between the twenty-fifth anniversary and this session when we celebrate its thirtieth anniversary, the Organization has proved its awareness of its responsibilities not to some, but to all its Members. Its devotion to the maintenance of peace has been balanced by an appreciation of the need to promote the economic and social well-being of all mankind. It has gone beyond pious statements delivered with great solemnity in this historic hall and then quickly forgotten. It has adopted the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States and has proclaimed a new international economic order, with an appropriate Program of Action. The World Population Conference, the World Food Conference, the third session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and the General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, all held under the auspices of the United Nations, are indicative of the increased preoccupation of our Organization with the need for results that will benefit its membership. Moreover, the seventh special session, which ended only a few days ago, convinces my delegation that our Organization is capable of rising to the challenges of the future.
112.	When the sixth special session was convened, there was discerned a definite antagonism to the aspirations of the poorer section of our membership. Rather than face the glaring disparities between those who have and those who have not, a desperate attempt was made to put blame where none was due. We left the sixth special session painfully aware of our lack of consensus. The seventh special session, by its positive achievement, has demonstrated the truth in the age-old saying that where there's a will there's a way.
113.	What is left is a demonstration of commitment by action to show that the awakening of Members of the United Nations to the need to be faithful to all the Articles of its Charter is not just one of those ephemeral developments which pass away once a 'strategy' has been adopted. We have the experience of the two strategies for the First and Second United Nations Development Decades to justify such a fear. AH too often we tend to forget that the Charter devotes two chapters, embodying 18 articles, to the question of international economic and social co-operation. In Article 55, the United Nations committed itself to the promotion of higher standards of living, full employment, solutions of international economic, social, health, and related problems, with a view to 'the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations'. In Article 56 of the Charter, all of us, Members of the Organization, pledge ourselves to take joint and separate action in co-operation with the Organization for the achievement of the purposes enunciated in Article 55.
114.	Therefore, if the inequity in the world economic system has persisted so long, the fault is not in the Charter; rather it is in the lack of political will by Member States to discharge their obligations. That will must now be shown positively to be present. For it seems to my delegation that events of the past two years ought to have shown in unmistakable terms that the poor, the downtrodden and the underprivileged countries will no longer accept the conditions which perpetuate their seemingly hopeless condition. If the rich nations can read the signs, if they can make genuine efforts at being partners in the accelerated progress of the developing countries, then a beginning will, have been made in fulfilling the Preamble to our Charter, 'to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war', and 'to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom'.
115.	The seventh special session ended with the unanimous endorsement in plenary of the measures proposed by its Ad Hoc Committee.4 My delegation expects that we shall all take swift action to bring about a new system of economic relationships between the developed and the developing countries. We expect early expansion and diversification of the exports of the developing countries. We expect an improvement in our terms of trade through a buffer- stock financing arrangement, involving producers and consumers within an integrated Program appropriately indexed to sustain and increase our purchasing power relative to the manufactured goods, technology and services which we import. The measures recommended in resolution 3362 (S-VII) for the transfer of real resources for financing development and for the reform of the international monetary system should also be implemented without delay. These measures are necessary to ensure an increased flow of concessional financial resources and a greater involvement of international financial institutions in the development strategies of the developing countries.
116.	We do not, of course, lose sight of the need for the developing countries themselves to co-operate more effectively in improving their economic conditions. To this end, a greater degree of collaboration on economic projects has to be developed. A good beginning has already been made in the willingness of the developing countries which are producers of oil to assist positively other developing countries which are in a slightly less advantageous position. Indeed, the assistance given by such countries over the past two years has been to the tune of 2.2 per cent of their gross national product. My own country, Nigeria, in spite of its own tremendous internal requirements, has contributed its own modest share towards the development process in other countries. In addition
to the bilateral assistance which we have provided for other developing countries, we have made available a substantial contribution to the African Development Bank in order to increase the Bank's capacity to give development loans to African countries. We intend, within the limit of our capacity, to continue this process. 1 should also refer to the co-operative effort which was concreted at Lagos in May this year, when 15 West African countries signed the Charter of the Economic Community of West African States. We hope that that charter will turn out to be the launching-pad for an economic grouping that will benefit all its members and their peoples.
117.	The United Nations provides the ideal forum for working out the mutually beneficial partnership implicit in the new world economic order. So also does it provide an indispensable stage for the preservation of international peace and security in conditions of sovereign equality of States, large and small. If it is to fulfill this role, it has to be strong and effective. The thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the Organization gives us a good opportunity once again to examine together in a constructive manner how best to strengthen the Organization and thus make it more responsive to the needs of a rapidly changing world. To pretend, as some powerful Members of the Organization do, that all is well with the Charter is to live in an ivory tower. On the one hand, criticisms are always made by the developing countries concerning the undemocratic set-up enshrined in the Charter. Through that system, a few countries are able to frustrate the will of the vast majority. On the other hand, developed countries have accused developing countries rather unfairly in my view of imposing a tyranny of the majority on die General Assembly. The upshot of these accusations and counter-accusations is the need to take a close look at the Charter.
118.	During its twenty-ninth session, the General Assembly adopted resolution 3343 (XXIX), which set up a Group of Experts with the mandate to submit a study containing proposals on structural changes within the United Nations system that would make it fully capable of dealing with problems of international economic co-operation in a comprehensive manner. This recognition of the need to update the structure of the United Nations so as to make it more responsive was proved right; for, in the report submitted by the Group of Experts, there were very constructive proposals which, by common consent, are to be referred for further action to the Ad Hoc Committee on the Restructuring of the Economic and Social Sectors of the United Nations System. In paragraph 10 of its report, the Group observed:
'Every serious reform proposal (as opposed to marginal proposals that amount to mere 'tinkering') is bound to cut across someone's vested interest in the status quo. A meaningful reform of the system, to take account of new requirements and developments, may involve the forgoing of some short- term interests and entrenched habits in favor of long-term interests in a workable international economic order.'3
119. No better advice could have been offered for the future growth of this Organization. No greater justification could be given for the wisdom of the General Assembly when, after a long debate, it adopted
resolution 3349 (XXIX), which created an Ad Hoc Committee on the Charter of the United Nations. My delegation regrets that the unco-operative attitude of certain Members has prevented the Committee from making progress. Without going into great detail, let me remind those who oppose even a simple review of the Charter of the following facts: first, that the United Nations today has a membership of 141 Members. Of this number, only 51, or slightly more than a third, were 'present at the creation'. If the two thirds which later subscribed to the Charter cannot even make suggestions for its improvement in the light of experience, then we will be made to feel that we are at best second-class Members. Secondly, even the founding fathers thought it wise not to preclude the possibility of amending the Charter: Article 109 makes elaborate provisions for reviewing the Charter, while Article 108 specifies the manner in which amendments shall come into force. Thirdly, changes are implicit in growth. My delegation looks forward to more positive developments in this issue. Meanwhile, the General Assembly at this session should pronounce its determination to work relentlessly for a more democratic set-up which will better fulfill the aspirations of all Members of our Organization.
120.	Several factors have proved conclusively that the super-Powers can no longer assume exclusive responsibility for international peace and security. Take the issue of disarmament, for instance: in spite of its place of primacy in the objectives of the Charter, it has almost become a lost cause, thanks to superPower collusion. The Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, which was intended as the main forum for disarmament negotiations, has been debilitated by a creeping paralysis. Its collective efforts are being frustrated by bilateral deals between the super-Powers which appear to them as progress, but which to the generality of the Members of the United Nations are tantamount to glossing over the real issues. The chief function of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament is not to get enmeshed in protracted negotiations on collateral and sub-collateral measures of disarmament. The goal we all aim at is general and complete disarmament under a system of international supervision. To attain this goal we have to agree on a comprehensive test-ban treaty.
121.	The lack of progress on this crucial issue continues to bedevil all other related disarmament questions, namely, the regime of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the prevention of a group of privileged nuclear Powers making a mockery of the concept of the sovereign equality of States; the reduction of the staggering expenditures in the military budgets of the affluent countries; and the diversion of human and material resources from the pursuit of the armaments race to the promotion of the economic and social progress of humanity as a whole.
122.	As far as we are concerned, there are no technical obstacles to the verification of a comprehensive test-ban regime which should prevent its early adoption, provided the political will and mutual trust exist. While we recognize the value of technical and scientific expertise in classifying the complex issues involved in disarmament negotiations, the work of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament should not be diverted into peripheral and marginal alleys in which annual seminars and symposia are conducted on this or that aspect of specific disarmament questions.
123.	In this connexion, my delegation regrets that a good opportunity for advancing the cause of disarmament was missed during the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The Review Conference' failed to rise to the task of providing more positive barriers against horizontal as well as vertical proliferation of nuclear weapons. The nuclear Powers parties to the Treaty cynically held back from giving assurances and guarantees that they would refrain from the use or threat of use of the deadly weapons. Similarly, there were no clear commitments on the part of the nuclear-weapon States that they would pursue the obligation incumbent upon them under article VI of the Treaty [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] to carry out meaningful negotiations with a view to achieving concrete measures of nuclear disarmament. For those of us who have willingly given up our nuclear options in becoming parties to the Treaty, the attitude of the nuclear Powers has served to confirm the inequity of a world dominated by super-Power hegemony. There is need for all States to confront the issue of disarmament in a more constructive and meaningful manner in a forum of sovereign equality. The proposed world disarmament conference can provide such a forum. If the attempt to convene such a conference continues to be frustrated, my delegation will not hesitate to join other third-world States in demanding that the General Assembly focus attention on disarmament in a special session.
124.	I should now like to touch upon some of the specific political issues involving international peace and security on which this Assembly must act.
125.	The past year has witnessed very startling developments in the liberation struggle, both in IndoChina and in Africa. The people of Viet Nam have reasserted their independence and can now look forward to taking their rightful place in this august Assembly. My delegation hopes that it will not be long before the obstacles being placed in the way of the admission of the two Viet Nams is removed. In Cambodia, too, a popular regime has been installed. My delegation is happy that the Cambodian people will now be able to harness its efforts for the reconstruction of its country and the rehabilitation of its war-ravaged economy. We welcome them back into our midst. We also note with satisfaction the emergence of Papua New Guinea to independence and look forward to welcoming this new country to the United Nations.
126.	In Africa, through the persistent struggle of the liberation movements, supported by all forces opposed to oppression, the battle cry has been sounded against Portuguese colonialism. The glorious example of the entry of Guinea-Bissau into this community of sovereign States has been followed at this session by the admission of Mozambique, Cape Verde and Sao Tome and Principe. We again congratulate those new countries on their achievements and look forward to working closely with them.
127.	We call upon the international community to rally to the assistance of these new nations, which are confronted with tremendous problems arising from their long colonial status. Sao Tome and Principe, as well as Cape Verde, urgently requires assistance in coping with the great influx of refugees who have been displaced by the Angolan situation. My delegation hopes that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees will take appropriate and urgent action to help in finding a solution to this humanitarian problem.
128.	Regrettably, Angola, whose emergence as a sovereign State and membership in our Organization we had looked forward to with hope, is engaged in a fratricidal conflict that is sapping its energy and diverting it from constructive pursuits. The Nigerian Government vehemently deplores the instigation of one group of Angolans against another. Most solemnly and in the name of humanity we call upon the outside meddlers in the Angolan situation to keep off and to give the Angolan people the chance of settling down to the immense task of nation-building. The Nigerian Government will not accept the truncation of Angola as now constituted. We do not believe there exists in Angola any problem that cannot be solved within a united Angolan nation. I therefore appeal to the Angolan leaders to place the interests of the Angolan nation and people before party and personal advantage. I sincerely hope that statesmanship among the Angolan leaders will yet prevail, for my delegation will derive great joy from being able to welcome a united, peaceful Angola into our midst before long.
129.	Notwithstanding the progress made in decolonization, imperialism still constitutes the most potent threat against international peace and security in southern Africa. The problem of Zimbabwe is a great reminder, if indeed one is needed, of the great hurdle that still has to be surmounted before we see the end of racism and imperialism. By an adroit act of political gamesmanship, the white rebel clique in Zimbabwe, aided by the racist regime in South Africa, almost succeeded in luring the international community into a sense of false security. We were almost led to believe that the rebel clique had at last read the signs, recognized the futility of its senseless policy and decided to take the indispensable steps towards ensuring for itself and its children conditions of peaceful and meaningful co-operation with the indigenous population it had so long oppressed. Regrettably, Ian Smith has once again shown his determination to wreck all chances of a peaceful transfer of power. By wrecking the talks between his illegal Government and the African National Council, by engaging in the dangerous game of trying to divide the nationalist united front, by seeking to hold talks with puppets in the assembly of tribal chiefs, Ian Smith is inviting an intensified armed struggle whose ultimate result is not in doubt.
130.	Since the United Nations is witness to the bad faith and unreliability of Ian Smith, it should give maximum support and encouragement to the nationalist' movement of Zimbabwe. The Federal Military Government of Nigeria pledges its unflinching support. My Government meanwhile calls on the African National Council to close ranks, to cast aside petty jealousies and personal ambitions, and to concentrate, in unity, on the task of ridding its fatherland of the oppression of the white rebels. 
131.	The situation in Namibia continues to deteriorate. Not only has South Africa flagrantly defied the United Nations; it has even refused to make a declaration, as required by Security Council resolution 366 (1974), that it would comply with the resolutions and decisions of the Organization. Besides, South Africa has persisted in its diabolical policy of Balkanizing Namibia through the creation of bantustans. Under the guise of permitting black and white ethnic groups of the Territory to determine their own future without interference, the Vorster regime has continued to perpetuate its stranglehold on Namibia. How can the entire world body look on helplessly when South Africa continues most blatantly to violate the tenets of our Organization? The Namibian people have almost exhausted their patience waiting hopefully for the United Nations to assume its responsibility. Are we going to fail them, or shall we resolve more than ever before to confront South Africa with the force necessary to bring about withdrawal? My delegation believes that if we have the political will we can in a short time solve the Namibia problem.
132.	To insist, as do some Members of the United Nations, that the situation created by South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia does not constitute a threat to international peace and security is to be guilty of multiple standards. The Namibian situation is capable of provoking a racial war on a continent which needs a long period of peace to recover from imperialist exploitation. I therefore hope that those who used their veto power to prevent effective action against South Africa will reconsider their position and recognize that their responsibility under the Charter extends to the world at large.
133.	At its twenty-ninth session, the General As- ;embly in its wisdom adopted resolution 3207 (XXIX), n which it called upon the Security Council to review the relationship between the United Nations and South Africa in the light of the constant violation by South Africa of the principles of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Unfortunately, the Security Council could not take a decision owing to the use of the veto by some of its permanent members. The rest of the story leading to the exclusion of South Africa from further participation in the work of the session is well known.
134.	The interesting thing is, however, that South Africa has now intensified its propaganda campaign to project an imaginary process of liberalization. As we all know, the truth is that nothing has changed. The most obnoxious aspects of apartheid are still very much in evidence. Rather than begin the necessary contacts on the basis of equality with the black South Africans, the racist regime prefers to conduct so- called dialog with independent African countries. Vorster will not talk to fellow South Africans who happen to be black, but he will wine and dine, and will even pay secret visits to, black leaders elsewhere.. The confusion which this monumental hypocrisy was intended to cause in the ranks of the OAU was, happily, exposed at the ninth extraordinary session of the OAU Council of Ministers held at Dar es Salaam last April. The Declaration adopted at that time confirmed Africa's view, first articulated in the Lusaka Manifesto, that friendship between South Africa and the rest of the continent can have as its basis only the abandonment of apartheid. To insist that meaningful dialog can be commenced with South Africa under its present leadership is to betray the oppressed non- whites in the country.
135.	The Federal Military Government of Nigeria acknowledges the sovereign right of each country to determine its policy on specific issues. However, the Federal Military Government also believes that certain self-evident facts should unite all Members of the United Nations on an issue such as apartheid, which is so abhorrent to our Charter. It is sheer self-deceit to speak of being opposed to apartheid while at the same timing maintaining diplomatic, economic and other forms of links with a regime based exclusively on apartheid. It is even more serious when some Members of this Organization continue to supply South Africa with the weapons it needs to protect and perpetuate its obnoxious system. It is therefore incumbent on this Assembly strongly to reaffirm its arms embargo on South Africa and to -demand the end of economic collaboration and all other forms of contact with South Africa. My delegation wishes to place on record its appreciation of the indefatigable effort of the Special Committee against Apartheid, in exposing the evils of apartheid, and we hope that all Members of the United Nations will join wholeheartedly in the great task of effectively annihilating apartheid. Let those who at this time choose to develop or strengthen contacts and co-operation with South Africa beware.
136.	My delegation is concerned that no solution has yet been found to the problem of Cyprus. We are apprehensive lest in this day and age the interests of a weak non-aligned country be sacrificed on the altar of big-Power politics. The current crisis in that island State was provoked and is sustained by the political and territorial ambitions of its big-Power neighbors who act ostensibly in protection of one or the other of the two sections of the Cypriot community.
137.	Until the Cypriot people as a whole are made to believe that their first loyalty is to Cyprus and not to their ancestral home either in Greece or in Turkey, so long will there be room left for outsiders to fish in the Cypriot troubled waters. Nigeria does not believe in big-Power enforced settlement of the problems of a weak State. The principle of equality of States enshrined in our Charter is the very antithesis of imposed solutions. We are not unmindful of the communal fears; however, we do not share the position of those who would rather partition Cyprus. The territorial integrity of that young State must be maintained. The General Assembly must once again call on all parties directly involved in the Cyprus problem to show constructive statesmanship and work for a solution on the basis of General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX).
138.	This Assembly will be faced once again with the unresolved problem of the Middle East and the intimately related question of Palestine. When we separated these two issues for discussion last year, we demonstrated, perhaps for the first time, our full recognition of the human tragedy created by the pro-longed upheaval in that area. The deprivation of their homeland inflicted on the Palestinian people and the' need to resettle them, not in refugee camps, not even in brotherly Arab countries, but in a country of their own, has become a most vital element in the search for meaningful and lasting peace in the area. The twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly gave somewhat overdue recognition to this aspect of the problem when it accorded Yasser Arafat the honor of addressing it. The Assembly then went further and accorded the Palestine Liberation Organization, the authentic voice of the Palestinian people, a place of honor in this Assembly and in other organs of the United Nations [resolution 3210 (XXIX)]. My delegation believes that these developments of the twenty- ninth session are indispensable steps towards peace. The people of Palestine must be associated closely with a settlement under whose umbrella they are expected to live.
139.	Regrettably, the threat to international peace and security which the situation in the Middle East constitutes still persists. The uncertainties in the course of events constitute a severe drawback in the pursuit of constructive efforts by the virile people of the area. The important issues are still unresolved even if some tentative progress has been made in creating conditions to facilitate peace contacts. My delegation believes that any breakthrough in any of the complex issues of the Middle East is a step for peace and must be welcome. The value of an all-or-nothing approach to a complex problem can be as doubtful as the arrogance which finds expression in the defiance of United Nations resolutions and genuine peace efforts. While we should therefore acclaim the recent accord, we must stress that lasting peace demands continuous movement. Israel must show positive signs of its willingness to abandon its defiant attitude and to negotiate on the basis of the resolutions of the United Nations. The goodwill of many Members of this Organization towards Israel has been more than vividly demonstrated in the decisions taken by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU, held at Kampala from 28 July to 1 August 1975 and the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Non-Aligned Countries held at Lima in August. Israel has the chance to reciprocate this goodwill and thus ensure for itself and its people peace within recognized borders. It is in the interest of international peace and security for Israel to be more constructive at this session of the Assembly; what is more, it is in the interest of the State of Israel.
140.	I dealt extensively at the beginning of my state-ment with the emphasis which our Organization has been placing on the economic development of Member States. This emphasis, which is long overdue, is in keeping with the ideals of our Charter. In the 30 years since that historic gathering in San Francisco which saw the birth of the United Nations, the glaring disparity between the few rich countries and the many poor countries has become more pronounced, to the point where urgent action is necessary if international peace and security are not to be jeopardized by open antagonism provoked by economic disparities. The Members of this Organization have within their capacity the means, and I hope the will, for spectacular progress in creating the conditions for a decent standard of life for everyone. The United Nations will be judged by the extent to which it is successful in combining this task with the equally vital job of up-holding peace and promoting self-determination and human dignity. Let it not be said of us that when we
had all the tools for making our Organization satisfy the yearnings of humanity we preferred to indulge our petty national self-interest rather than work for the over-all good of humanity.














1976
The election of Ambassador. Amerasinghe to preside over this session of the General Assembly could not have come at a more opportune time. He is a man totally committed to the cause of justice and the restoration of human dignity in the areas of the world where both attributes are being trampled with reckless abandon. He represents a country which has actively promoted the cause of world peace and universal progress through common discussion of problems in conditions of sovereign equality. Having the opportunity to participate in the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries held in Colombo two months ago, I saw at first hand the great devotion of the Government and people of his country, Sri Lanka, to the promotion of international friendship, on which peace and progress must necessarily rest. On behalf of the Nigerian delegation, therefore, I congratulate him warmly and pledge him our support in guiding the deliberations of this session.
145.	I should like also to pay a tribute to Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim, whose devotion to duty and enthusiasm in the pursuit of the objectives of the Charter of the United Nations have endeared him to us. Nigeria's confidence in him is unqualified, and Africa's hope for his continued service to this Organization was reflected in an appropriate motion which I had the honor to propose, adopted at the last OAU conference held in Mauritius in July this year. 
146.	Since the inception of our great Organization, real peace has eluded the world. We have groped our way in search of better quality of life for all mankind. The successful solution of the problem of strife, hunger and poverty that plague the international community hinges on our understanding and realization that we, the Members of this Organization, are closely interdependent. Racial and national diversity are facts of life which do not, however, preclude coexistence. Ideology, like nationalism, serves as the motive force for group survival, but need not supplant coexistence among groups and nations.
147.	Although banners have been formed and placards invented, in spite of our common goals and objectives, progress appears lost in cliches. We are all agreed that the purpose of our Organization is the promotion of human well-being, the dignity of man and a well-ordered inter-national society in order to ensure the survival of the human race. These are basic human values and common experiences which transcend the boundaries of race, creed and color. The evolution of planet earth and its people does not ignore these reactions of man, nor can they be permanently suppressed.
148.	Collectively, we must share our various burdens and distribute our benefits. We must appreciate that, through the matrix and complexities of the present state of affairs, one of the fundamental instincts of man is his affinity with those who have shared common experiences.
149.	Unfortunately, the present international economic relationship does not reflect the ideals of collective security and responsiveness to the realities of international order based on realistic co-operation in a world divided between the 'haves' and the 'have-nots'. Self-reliance must therefore necessarily be emphasized, in addition to close co-operation among those who share common experiences and objectives.
150.	Nigeria belongs to the third world, encompassing the non-aligned movement and the Group of 77 within the framework of the United Nations system. These groups are not inconsistent with the aims an objectives of our Charter. It is therefore sad to observe in some statements made earlier in the course of the general debate that some see this co-operation as a trend to dissipate and emasculate the effectiveness of the United Nations. It is even sadder to note that these criticisms emanate from those who have formed themselves into economic, military and political blocs for the purpose of defending their interests.
151.	It is very clear to all that the non-aligned movement was born in the wake of international ideological conflicts with the objective of defusing the cold war tension. As long as these ideological conflicts exist, albeit at a reduced level, the non-aligned movement will continue to serve its purpose. As long as the world continues to be divided into the 'haves' and the 'have-nots', the developing countries will continue to seek ways and means to articulate programs for collective self-reliance in protection of their legitimate interest within the New International Economic Order and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States.
152.	We in Nigeria, in spite of our population and our gigantic development program to combat illiteracy, disease and poverty, and to provide the infrastructure lacking from years of colonial neglect, have diverted a modest but substantial proportion of our resources to economic co-operation with other developing countries, particularly in our region. Along with the international community, Nigeria responded to the compelling needs of our neighbors in the Sahel region. We have contributed modestly to infrastructural development in our region. We have, in response to the needs of our region, afforded bilateral assistance to our neighbors.
153.	In concert with our neighbors, we have embarked on programs to develop our natural resources in the Chad Basin Commission, the Niger-Nigeria joint Commission and the River Niger Commission. Nigeria is embarking on a gigantic program to improve the navigability of the River Niger and to promote easy access to the sea through Nigerian ports, for our own benefit and that of our land-locked neighbors.
154.	Also in our region, we are dedicated to making economic and social co-operation a reality with the establishment of the Economic Community of West African States. Here again, Nigeria is committed to playing its full part in the implementation of the aims and objectives of the Organization.
155.	Recently, Nigeria made available to the African Development Bank the sum of $80 million as a trust fund to provide soft loans to the neediest of African States. In addition, so as to strengthen the Economic Commission for Africa and to maximize its operational effectiveness, we have provided the sum of $1 million to augment its resources from the United Nations.
156.	These are all modest and practical measures. Despite the pressures of internal requirements, we have managed to share our resources with other developing countries.
157.	Nigeria is fully committed to co-operation among developing countries. We shall fulfill any obligations which flow from these commitments, be it in the non-aligned solidarity fund for economic and social development or in the special fund for the financing of buffer stocks for raw materials and primary products of interest to developing countries.
158.	As a means of assisting developing countries outside Africa, Nigeria has increased its contribution to inter-national financial institutions in order to enhance their capacity for providing additional resources for development. Nigeria has also joined with other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC] in launching the OPEC Fund for Development and in making substantial contributions towards the operation of the International Fund for Agricultural Development.
159.	The developed market-economy countries and, to a certain extent, the countries with centrally planned economies have gone through a devastating recession and an unprecedented inflation and unemployment, from which they are only just recovering. One of the main contributory factors to this recovery has been the availability of the huge investment by third-world countries, particularly from the oil-exporting countries. In any case, the recycling of surplus liquidity from third-world countries contributed in no small measure to this recovery.
160.	This is interdependence. This amply illustrates the desirability for a reorientation of approaches and patterns of solution in the context of the new international economic order, based on reciprocity.
161.	Developing States like ours, in view of the constraints on our economy, can play a role to the extent which I have attempted to outline. It is the responsibility and obligation of the developed countries to make concessions and adjustments in their approach to international economic relations for the development of the entire human society. I believe that it is about time that the international community began to take positive steps to show that it regards itself as an organic whole and, like any nation State, avoid fragmentation of society into groups composed of the rich and the poor.
162.	The results of recent international conferences have not encouraged us to believe that these realities of economic interdependence have been fully appreciated and accepted. There is a growing frustration among third-world countries and a polarization between the 'haves' and the 'have-nots'. Only two weeks ago, in Mexico City,  the third-world countries met to articulate measures designed to ensure their collective survival. If this lack of sensitivity continues, this polarization could entrench a permanent chasm.
163.	This is a situation that we would wish to avoid. We therefore call for a reappraisal of attitudes and positions towards international economic co-operation. All of us must demonstrate a willingness to adopt concrete measures to ensure: a free flow of trade; stability in the real income of developing countries; easy access to capital market on preferential terms; the attainment of the official development assistance target; the acceleration of the pace of industrialization in developing countries; the transfer of appropriate technology on favorable terms and conditions, and the redeployment of suitable industries from developed countries to developing countries; and the finding of urgent and adequate solutions of the problem of the official debts of developing countries, particularly the least developed countries.
164.	It is distressing to note that, while they quibble over funds for economic development, powerful States Members of this Organization continue to lavish outstanding amounts on armaments. The current estimate of annual expenditure on armaments by the developed countries is $300 billion, in contrast with a mere $20 billion in the flow of financial resources from the developed to the developing countries. When, therefore, we emphasize the imperative need for disarmament, we bear in mind both the security and economic implications of disarmament. We continue to believe that every country has a role to play in disarmament because it concerns peace, and peace is indivisible. But year after year, while we continue to appear to play some role in disarmament negotiations, a feeling has been created that we are gradually being relegated to an observer status. The truth is that progress in disarmament is being hampered by the super-Power concept of the balance of strategic power-in other words, a balance of terror. The vertical proliferation of nuclear and conventional armaments continues unabated. In the meantime, the prospects of a nuclear horizontal proliferation of nuclear armaments have become the nightmare of mankind.
165.	The third world has continued to maintain that the disproportionate human and financial resources committed to armaments and to the acquisition of nuclear capabilities for destructive purposes are totally unjustified in an era of relaxation of East-West tension. Last year, the Assembly reiterated the link between disarmament and development, and requested the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament to continue to explore this link [resolution 3470 (XXX)]. We in Nigeria fully support this move. It is our conviction that efforts should be made in this direction. Nigeria has opted for utilizing its resources for development and international economic co-operation. We believe in peace; we live at peace with our neighbors and have not fallen prey to the compulsive urge to become a phantom military power against the grain of reality. In this same forum last year, I said that if the attempt to convene a world disarmament conference continued to be frustrated, my delegation would not hesitate to join in demanding the convening of a special session of the General Assembly to focus attention on disarmament.  The Fifth Conference of non-aligned countries in Colombo emphasized the need for such a session when it decided to work towards convening it not later than 1978. The General Assembly should take appropriate steps at this session towards this end.
166.	Nigeria regrets that the problems of the Middle East still defy solution. The people of Palestine continue to live in refugee camps or to be scattered in many foreign countries. Nigeria wishes once more to reaffirm its belief that there will be no durable and lasting solution of the Middle East problems except one which, inter alia, takes into account the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians to a homeland of their own and the right of all States in the region to exist in peace within secure and recognized borders.
167.	It is obvious that the impasse in the Middle East imbroglio constitutes a threat to international peace and security. Nigeria reiterates its call for the total and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from all the Arab territories it occupied as a result of the 1967 Middle East war. Nigeria fully supports the idea of convening a conference to which all the parties concerned in the Middle East problem, including the Palestinians, should be invited to discuss and settle all the issues at stake.
168.	Allow me now to turn to the dominant theme of this session and the major preoccupation of my delegation, the problem of southern Africa. Before we disperse to our various capitals in December, we may witness the culmi-nation of momentous events concerning the explosive situation in southern Africa. Without being unmindful of other issues that will confront the General Assembly, I venture to say that this session will justify itself by the way it reacts to the rapidly evolving situation in that part of Africa. It has been clear for some time that that area is the last bastion for the preservation of everything that is the antithesis of the Charter of our Organization: namely, colonial exploitation, deprivation of elementary human rights, the blatant practice of racial discrimination, the dehumanization of the indigenous people of the area, daily exploitation by powerful economic interests and, what is more, the perpetration of that heinous crime against humanity, apartheid. It has also been apparent that the United Nations, which Africa looked up to for the eradication of the evils that plague southern Africa, was being increasingly rendered powerless to discharge its obligations. The cynicism and hypocrisy of those who should be in the vanguard of the United Nations action against the racist imperialists of southern Africa rendered this Organization almost irrelevant in the drama that was unfolding in that area. Even those who normally sympathize with the plight of the misused and oppressed people of southern Africa began to wonder whether we had not reached the end of the road as far as liberation on the African continent was concerned.
169.	The continent of Africa has for three centuries been afflicted with a malaise inflicted from outside our continent. We are all too aware of this historic evolution-an evolution tinted with despair. We have always looked forward to, and relied on, the conscience of mankind and the changing value systems of the international community, in our continuous search for peace, justice and equality. Africa has been a continent of unfulfilled hopes. It appears to be in a state of flux. Once we hoped that slavery was behind us only to be engulfed in colonialism. Next, we hoped for freedom-only to be immersed in a whirlpool of frustrations. Today, the dimensions of these uncertainties are reflected in the lack of will on the part of the Western World to grapple effectively with the problems of southern Africa. The racist regime of South Africa has compartmentalized its people into classes. Some are categorized as white, some as Colored and others as black. The black man, in his own country, is treated as subhuman. The white man, by the powers inherited through the same system of colonialism, has by brute force transformed colonialism into an instrument of repression, oppression and chicanery. This process has been synthesized into a system which is notoriously known as apartheid, a veritable crime against humanity. A major part of the world community continues to be indifferent, judging by its responses to and its actions regarding this problem.
170.	In South Africa, Vorster, like his predecessors, is a great ally and companion in the exploitation of the resources of South Africa in the interest of the white minority and the Western world. He is today being proclaimed the hero in the complex process which is yet to unfold in the search for a solution in Zimbabwe and Namibia. This adulation is misplaced and unacceptable.
171.	First, my Government has not seen any positive basic shift in policy by Vorster and his racist henchmen which can lead to a just solution to the problems of southern Africa generally. Thus Vorster is merely being given a ticket of respectability for a role he has not played.
172.	Secondly, Vorster has not relented in spite of the impression being created that he has ceased his intervention in propping up the racist regime in Zimbabwe.
173.	Thirdly, the nationalists and most African leaders will not wish for a settlement in which Vorster is appearing to play a role.
174.	Fourthly, the quid pro quo for the so-called co-operation of Vorster in resolving the problem of Zimbabwe appears to be not only this respectability which I mentioned earlier but also an agreement to relegate to the background the basic issues of apartheid, which is the crux of the problems of South Africa.
175.	In South Africa itself, while our attention is being diverted, 26 October is almost here with us, when the first 'bantusan', the Transkei, will be declared 'independent', a show window in the 'bantustanization' process.
176.	It is worth mentioning here what I said in the Security Council a few days ago, that 'we will not accept any dialogue with the racist regime of South Africa without its renouncing the policy of apartheid.. .'.  In addition, we must not be diverted from the reality of the situation in
. South Africa, where 'bantustanization', the quintessence of apartheid, continues to be implemented.
177.	As I also stated in the Security Council, no African will endorse a solution in South Africa whereby 6 to 7 million blacks are to be forcibly herded into 200 scattered locations within South Africa that will be constituted into about eight 'bantustans'. Nineteen million owners of the land cannot be repressed by brute force or be bullied by 3.5 million whites at the muzzle of the gun and resettled into 13 per cent of the poorest land areas in South Africa.
178.	We shall never relent until the South African racists appreciate that such abuse of power, such degradation of human values, cannot stand the test of time. We in Nigeria are convinced that the genocide being perpetrated by the racist regime in South Africa, to which some powerful Members of this Assembly continue to turn a blind eye, cannot solve in perpetuity the basic problems of human resistance and reaction to suffering.
179.	The events of the past few weeks ought to have made that point clear even to the most complacent supporter of the apartheid regime and its instruments of terror. We have all been living witnesses to the spontaneous uprising of the oppressed people of South Africa against the barbarism of the Vorster regime and its apartheid policy. The children born in the wake of Sharpeville -events that shocked the world 16 years ago -who are now in their teens have spearheaded the beginning of a revolution that is bound to destroy apartheid and its apostles. Against the arsenals of the Vorster Government, these children are daily showing a determination to sacrifice their blood for the destruction of apartheid.
180.	Apartheid pervades every fact of life in South Africa. Combating it requires action at all levels. Following the African action at the Montreal Olympics, I hope that those who hide under the hypocritical view of separating sports from politics now realize the depth of our feelings. Apartheid does not exempt any sphere of human activity from its very long arm. Therefore, anyone who believes he can verbally condemn apartheid but in practice helps to sustain it must count on concerted African reaction.
181.	My delegation is extremely concerned that in spite of the record of the Vorster regime, in spite of numerous United Nations resolutions, an important Member of our Organization has decided to co-operate with South Africa in a very sensitive and dangerous area nuclear technology. Itself a nuclear Power, France knows the danger of the weapon. As a permanent member of the Security Council, France knows what danger the Vorster regime constitutes to international peace and security, especially as South Africa has refused to join the regime of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Yet, in spite of all those facts, France has decided to encourage South Africa's nuclear ambition, thus making real Africa's fear of nuclear blackmail by South Africa.
182.	Even with the conclusion of the safeguards agreement between France, South Africa and the International! Atomic Energy Agency, Africa's fears cannot be allayed. For the safeguards agreement is no guarantee that South Africa will not divert nuclear material to non-peaceful purposes. In the interest of the security of Africa, therefore, this session of the General Assembly must call on France to cancel its nuclear power deal with South Africa. France, which has a lot of goodwill, as well as economic interests, in Africa, cannot continue to presume on Africa's verbal protests alone in the ever-growing chain of France's contacts with South Africa in defiance of the international community. I hope that France will take this friendly advice with all the seriousness in which it is given.
183.	The Federal Military Government of Nigeria believes that the call for change has been sounded by the Africans and other non-whites in South Africa; the international community must listen, to the call and must give all assistance.
184.	Last week 1 had the opportunity to state in the Security Council Nigeria's views on Namibia.15 The basis of an end to Vorster's illegal occupation of the Territory should be Security Council resolution 38S (1976) which, characteristically, Vorster has ignored. In keeping with his usual trick of confusing the unwary, Vorster has convened a fake constitutional conference in Windhoek. The facts about that conference are too well known to be repeated. That conference is a gross insult to the international community. It did not deliberate, and was not intended by Vorster to deliberate, on the fundamental issues. It merely rubber-stamped the South African plan for a so-called independence 'with reasonable certainty' in December 1978.
185.	The world community has laid down specific conditions for the process of self-determination for Namibia. Those conditions include the unconditional withdrawal of South African forces from Namibia, the release of all political prisoners, the maintenance of the territorial integrity of Namibia, and negotiations between the Vorster regime and the authentic representatives of the Namibian people, SWAPO, on the modalities for the withdrawal of the South African administration. It is the hope of my delegation that the United Nations will not relent in its determination to ensure the implementation of those conditions. SWAPO must be given all necessary support to continue and intensify the struggle against South African atrocities in Namibia. It is the responsibility of the United Nations to ensure that an independent Namibia, under the leadership of SWAPO, will take its place in the community of nations very soon.
186.	It is quite clear to my delegation that a number of factors have led to the present situation in Zimbabwe. First is the nationalist military pressure which has shattered the resistance of the rebel regime of Ian Smith. Second is the increased material and political support that the Zimbabwe People's Army has enjoyed from progressive forces all over the world and, in particular, from the front-line States. Third is the continued pressure of the United Nations for the maintenance of mandatory sanctions against the illegal regime. The combination of those factors has obviously brought the rebels virtually to their knees.
187.	My Government believes that those pressures must be kept up and not relaxed until the racist minority regime in Salisbury has been completely toppled. Nigeria accepts its responsibilities in this respect and will continue to discharge them.
188.	In keeping with the Lusaka Manifesto on Southern Africa and the Dar es Salaam declaration to which we subscribe, Nigeria notes with considerable interest that arrangements are being made for a constitutional conference as a follow-up of the Anglo-American initiatives on Zimbabwe. While we welcome the efforts to work towards a negotiated settlement, we should not be lured by Ian Smith into an impossible and unworkable position. Such is likely to be the result of the proposals for an interim Government announced by the leader of the rebel regime. According to Ian Smith, there is to be a council of ministers with a black first minister and a Council of State with legislative powers to be white dominated. It is obvious to us that the functioning of the council of ministers will be immobilized by that arrangement.
189.	It is also clear that arrangements whereby the law-enforcing institutions -the military, finance and the judiciary- would be controlled by white ministers is unrealistic. An interim Government so constituted could and would easily interfere with the forces of change and thwart the process of evolution to majority rule, with their advantage of retaining the forces of law and order in Zimbabwe. Once those arrangements have given the racist government legality, there is the likelihood that, as soon as sanctions are removed and guerrilla action stopped, the racist Government of Ian Smith would renege on its obligations, to judge by the experience of the past.
190.	We also understand that a trust fund is being set up for the purpose of compensating the white minority in Rhodesia. Those who wish to set up the fund appear to be oblivious to the suffering of thousands of blacks who are in goals and refugee camps and of many others in exile in various parts of the world. Nigeria is opposed to any such solution, which would not take the needs of the entire people in Zimbabwe, black and white, into consideration and would entrench white security at the expense of the blacks. Nigeria hopes, in addition, that independent Zimbabwe would not be burdened by such indebtedness for financing white security.
191.	I should make it clear that no solution in Zimbabwe can be expected to succeed unless the military wing and all ideological shades of the liberation struggle are carried along in any negotiations; otherwise, we shall again be faced with civil strife and with the world Powers jockeying for positions of advantage and aggravating the problems of Zimbabwe.
192.	I said earlier that this session of the General Assembly will to a large extent be judged by its reaction to the rapidly evolving events in southern Africa. Having played a commendable role in the process of decolonization, the United Nations cannot now be a mere bystander when the final push against the last bastion of imperialism and racism in Africa is in progress.
193.	We in Africa have faith -faith in the inexorable forces of the wind of change which nothing can stop; faith in the human spirit which, as has been shown over and over, will not perpetually submit to oppression; faith in the basically good and sympathetic nature of the generality of mankind; faith that those who profit by oppression will find that in the long run they are bound to lose, unless they face realities early enough; faith, above all, that the United
Nations will ultimately live up to the ideals of its Charter, notwithstanding the obstacles placed in its path.








1977

106. It is a great honour and privilege for me to be here today to address this assembly of world nations. As numerous representatives and other well-wishers have already done before me, I wish, in the name of the Nigerian Government and people, to convey our heartfelt congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your election to the presidency of the thirty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. In view of the length of the agenda, as well as the complexity of the issues before us at this session, we have no doubt that you will have to draw generously upon all those qualities of statesmanship which have marked you out for this unique recognition. In considering also the universally acknowledged position of Yugoslavia as a bastion of the non- aligned concept and your personal calibre as a statesman, we are confident that you will acquit yourself most creditably in the discharge of your onerous duties.
107.	I should like to convey the greetings of the Nigerian Government and people to this Assembly and, in particular, their best wishes for a successful session. This is not simply one more routine annual session of the United Nations General Assembly, but rather one that must rededicate itself anew to those noble principles and objectives enshrined in the Charter and, in particular, to those that express the hope of saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war, of maintaining international peace and security, of developing friendly relations among States on the basis of equality of sovereignty, and of devising a way to solve existing disputes by peaceful means. It is against that background and in that spirit that we ardently hope that the current session will pursue its task over the next two months. We pledge the full co-operation of the Nigerian delegation in the fulfilment of those objectives in the over-all interests of world peace, justice and security.
108.	It might perhaps be pertinent to recall here that the world of 1977 is a far cry from those eventful days of the immediate post-war period of 1945, when the world, freshly emerged from the nightmare of a carnage unprecedented in human history, ardently desired and sought ways and means to prevent a recurrence of global war. On two occasions within this century mankind indulged in colossal and barbaric destruction of human life and property, only to discover at the end that the interrelationships of peoples must be based on justice, and that any other approach to the interaction of men and nations will sooner or later result in violence and tragedy for mankind.
109.	A substantial part of what has now come to be known as the 'third world' was then completely unconcerned with the ideological issues or the historical events that led to the two wars. In the process of the evolution of colonial history after 1945, a different type of struggle on a global scale ensued. During that period only a minority of the nations now represented here today were considered capable of exercising the sovereign attributes that determined the course of human history over the next decade- and-a-half, until the irrepressible cause of human freedom eventually triumphed in the early 1960s, and the erstwhile colonial peoples took their rightful place within this august assembly of nations.
110.	The entire continent of Africa was represented at the historic United Nations Conference on International Organization at San Francisco by three independent States; and that was, moreover, the total African participation in the ceremony of signing the original United Nations Charter by the founding nations, three out of a grand total of 51 Member States.
111.	But the world has changed since then, and African States now constitute nearly one third of this prestigious Organization. Besides, if one considers the inherent imperfection of all human institutions, and the self-evident fact that all man-made institutions are subject to change, it seems quite clear that the newly independent nations of the third world in general, and of Africa in particular, are now grossly under-represented in practically all the major organs of the United Nations. Our struggles for a review of the relevant provisions of the Charter that would lead to a more equitable representation of nations on the basis of present- day realities will continue unabated, and we are confident that, given the necessary political will on all sides, this objective can be achieved.
112.	But Africa's struggles, and the struggles of the entire third world, go far beyond the cause of equitable representation within United Nations organs. They transcend the limited objectives of the United Nations Charter, touching as they do on the very foundations of justice and human freedom. Since its inception the idea of the United Nations and its system have been continuously subjected to intellectual and physical attack from all quarters and shades of opinion in spite of the self-evident nature of the superiority of justice over injustice, of peace over violence, and of freedom over bondage.
113.	At this point I should like to refer to the cause of decolonization and the eradication of racism from those parts of Africa that are still labouring under the oppressive rule of colonialism and of intransigent minority regimes.
114.	In Zimbabwe alone we have witnessed with dismay the strange phenomenon, unprecedented in recent colonial history, of a minority white regime in rebellion against the colonizing Power, and getting away with it for 12 years despite all the efforts to persuade the administering Power to acknowledge and discharge its obligations to the 6 million indigenous people, who continue to be denied their basic human rights in defiance of the Charter of our Organization. All our appeals have been met with half-hearted measures, and the invention of superficial economic sanctions that are full of loop-holes. Today, therefore, the racist regime in rebellion can still boast that the white minority has a more viable economy and enjoys a higher standard of living. But it still has to contend with the unwavering dedication, patriotism and grim determination of the nationalist liberation movements. The nationalists and freedom fighters will continue to stand ready to pay the supreme sacrifice rather than live ignominiously in perpetual bondage. Their cause is just, and their struggles sacred. Their sacrifices will not be in vain, because time is on their side and Africa stands by them, and they enjoy the full solidarity of all freedom-loving peoples throughout the world. In this regard it is necessary to emphasize once again that the Nigerian Government and people are totally committed to the cause of freedom and justice in that part of our continent. This we consider as a duty that must be performed, and we are determined to restore the honour and dignity that belong to that continent and to all its inhabitants, at whatever cost.
115.	I must also place on record here once again the appreciation of the Nigerian Government and people for the laudable role which the United Nations has played in the past, and has continued to play, so that even in southern Africa the basic right of man to freedom may be quickly restored. The United Nations archives are rich and overflowing with resolutions about ending the illegal regime in Rhodesia so that a free Zimbabwe may be born. The good intentions behind most of these resolutions have never been in doubt, and we would probably have achieved a positive result by now but for the combination of open support of the illegal regime by their fellow racists of South Africa and the clandestine support or tacit sabotage by those who profess to believe in democracy at home but prefer to espouse the cause of fascism in Africa.
116.	It is equally important that we mention in this regard the current proposals jointly made by the United Kingdom and the United States of America for a peaceful settlement in Rhodesia, otherwise known as the Anglo-American proposals, and recently made public in broad outline form. We have given very careful and exhaustive consideration to these proposals, and our view is that, in spite of obvious defects and weakness, mostly of an ambiguous nature, the proposals may well deserve to be given a chance. In working out the detailed implementation of these proposals these defects and weaknesses must be removed. For this reason among others, we have supported the steps taken by the Security Council to authorize the Secretary-General to appoint a representative in Rhodesia as required in these proposals. We note with satisfaction the expeditious steps taken so far.
117.	Having said this, however, I consider it imperative to sound a note of warning that Nigeria will never be party to any solution in Zimbabwe that could be remotely interpreted as a sell-out of the 6 million people of that land. Our objective is, unequivocally, a surrender of power by the minority to the majority of the population. We have, therefore, naturally condemned all manoeuvres, such as the frantic search by the rebel regime for a so-called international settlement, as totally unacceptable.
118.	And finally on this point, we should like to record warm tributes to the constructive role that the independent States adjacent to Rhodesia, otherwise known as the front-line States, have continued to play in the search for a solution there, by peaceful negotiations if possible, and through the barrels of guns if necessary.
119.	The former League of Nations Trust Territory of South West Africa, now Namibia under United Nations administration but still illegally occupied by the Vorster regime of South Africa, is one other area of our continent with which we are profoundly preoccupied. We believe, too, that the United Nations is equally preoccupied with events within the Territory on account of the special responsibility imposed on us for the suffering people of Namibia by the termination of South Africa's Mandate over the Territory, which has been so grossly abused. We are greatly encouraged by the enthusiasm which the Secretary-General has shown in his efforts to reassert United Nations control over the Territory and we can only hope that these efforts, in combination with the current dialogue by some Member States with the Vorster regime, will persuade the racists of South Africa of the utter futility of trying to stem the tide of freedom in southern Africa. We salute the leaders of SWAPO and-pay warm tributes to the devotion of that Organization and its determination to free Namibia from illegal occupation. We wish to assure this Assembly that we in Nigeria will not relax our efforts to see Namibia free. We look forward therefore to welcoming Namibia here next year to the comity of sovereign and independent nations.
120.	African liberation efforts will, of course, never be complete until the 18 million non-white people inside South Africa itself are free from the clutches of the minority racist regime. This case of man's inhumanity to man that continues to be perpetuated in South Africa is unparalleled within any other civilized society of modern times. In the context of apartheid the black man is considered subhuman, and he has been subjected to all forms of indignity in his own land—in order, we are told paradoxically, to defend Christendom and Western civilization. While the events in Sharpeville remain fresh in our minds, we are living witnesses to indescribable horrors perpetrated against innocent and defenceless youth and students in Soweto and other segregated areas of black concentration in South Africa. But the youths of Soweto have proved beyond any doubt—if anyone ever doubted— that a people's yearnings for freedom and human dignity cannot be suppressed by force of arms or by sheer intimidation. We have seen Hitler fall, and the history books are replete with accounts of the fall of similar dictators. We are firmly determined, therefore, that the case of Vorster's totalitarian regime in South Africa shall not prove an exception.

121.	The South African regime, of course, has been turned into a military power in Africa by those who would rather secure the economic and so-called strategic advantages of the Cape than consider the more legitimate yearnings of an oppressed people for justice and human dignity. At the recent World Conference for Action against Apartheid, which Nigeria had the honour and privilege of arranging in collaboration with the United Nations, we served notice to all such double-dealers, and in particular to the multinational companies, that they would have to decide to choose between our hospitality and their adventurism by which they prop up the oppressive regime in South Africa. This is a solemn undertaking of the Nigerian Government and I should like to repeat here that we have established an economic intelligence unit which will provide necessary information and recommend action against such collaborators with the racist regimes, who at the same time avail themselves of the hospitality and magnanimity of our people and the benefits of our economy.
122.	If I have dwelt at such length in my statement on the question of freedom and human dignity in southern Africa it is because this issue occupies a central and unique position in the Nigerian Government's policies. But this is not to say that we are not concerned with such other pressing international issues as disarmament, the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, the creation of a new and more equitable world economic order, the so-called North-South dialogue and the interplay of great Power rivalries in Africa and the Middle East.
123.	We have noted with satisfaction that steps are being taken to convene sometime in the coming year a special session of this Assembly on the vexed and seemingly intractable problem of disarmament, a solution to which, although urgent, has proved so elusive for us all these many years past. I note with particular satisfaction in this regard that Nigeria has the honour of participating in the preparatory work, and we look forward anxiously to a positive outcome at both the special session and the world conference that might eventually follow.
124.	The reasons for our anxiety over the question of disarmament and our serious concern in this regard derive, of course, from the recognition that if the unbridled race in the production of weapons of mass destruction and mutual annihilation between the super-Powers were to continue at the present pace we should be faced with the near certainty of a third world war, with all the attendant tragedy and human suffering that it would imply. In the eventuality of a nuclear holocaust there would probably be no victors, and the human race as a whole would be the loser since the generalized destruction that would result would obviously recognize no political barriers. We hope, therefore, that the gravity of the threat posed to world peace and security is equally well recognized by the super-Powers and that the time will soon come when the valuable resources at present devoted to such a dangerous pursuit will be more fruitfully deployed for the greatest good of the greatest section of mankind.
125.	In this regard I am encouraged by the growing detente among the super-Powers. Such co-operation in technological, economic and other fields is the surest way to develop mutual confidence through interdependence, to lead to less tension, and to encourage disarmament.
126.	The same remarks are equally applicable to the noble intentions that inspired the signatories to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. It is also essential to add here a note of caution: while we of the third world fully appreciate the wise objectives behind this Treaty we shall not sit down as helpless onlookers while the means of nuclear technology are being tacitly transferred to delinquent and racist enemies in South Africa. We condemn such collaboration with the apartheid regime, from whatever quarter, as strongly as We are determined that the rest of Africa shall not be found a sitting duck for racist aggression if and when such an eventuality should ever arise.
127.	It is our ardent hope and desire that Africa shall remain a nuclear-free zone, provided of course that this hope is not rendered naive by the merchants of horror and the enemies of humanity.
128.	I believe it is hardly necessary to repeat here again that the vast majority of our nations in the third world have chosen the path of non-alignment as a philosophy in the conduct of our foreign policy. This means, in essence, that we welcome the friendship and co-operation of all the nations on the basis of mutual respect and complete sovereign equality. We therefore have the greatest pleasure to welcome the assumption by the heroic Republic of Viet Nam of its rightful place in this assembly of nations.
129.	I commenced this address by referring to the Objective of our Organization, as enshrined in the Charter, to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. In our view, this must be interpreted to include also the urgent need for peace, human rights and human dignity, all of which are inextricably tied up to tile restoration of economic justice and the establishment of a more equitable world economic order, Here again, it is our view that the fortunes of all nations in the modern world are totally interdependent; that, were the present economic inequalities between the rich and poor nations to continue unchecked, we would be facing a bleak future; and that ultimate prospects under these conditions could hardly be less menacing than those of a nuclear war. It is for this reason that we welcome the apparent commitment of the North-South dialogue to find a more equitable order that would end, once and for all, our present division into 'haves' and 'have-nots'. We should all hope and pray that the United Nations will continue its present admirable role in this regard, particularly with regard to raising the living standards of those millions of people in the under 
Developed nations of the world who are still living precariously below the subsistence level.
130.	We in Africa are profoundly concerned about the tussle for areas of political and military influence by the great Powers on our continent, which have tended to deny us the right and ability to settle purely internal African problems in the African way. Examples of foreign intervention at present exist in large numbers in that easily destabilized continent, and I need not mention any specific cases here.
131.	I do wish to mention, however, the case of the equally uncertain prospects for peace in the Middle East where the State of Israel has doggedly held on to Arab lands conquered by force of arms. Nigeria is unequivocally opposed to any expansionist policy by any one State against the territory of another, and we have therefore given full support to the deprived Arabs in their efforts to recover their territorial integrity. This we shall continue to do until Israel vacates every inch of the territory it acquired by force of arms and until the world has duly recognized that the Palestinians, too, are entitled to a homeland of their own, in exercise of their right of self-determination.
132.	In conclusion, may I say once again how greatly I value and appreciate this unique opportunity to participate in the work of the current thirty-second session of the General Assembly of our great Organization, and to share with you our thoughts on some of the various burning issues on your agenda.







1978



1.	Mr. President, I wish to congratulate you on your unanimous election to the presidency of this Assembly. I trust that your judgement, skill and, even more, your renowned integrity in your country's political life and in international relations will facilitate the achievement of our objective of reaching the right decisions on most issues on our long agenda. My country enjoys excellent relations with your great country, Colombia. The bonds of friendship between our two nations and our common commitment to peace in the world and to the promotion of the universal well-being of mankind should assure you of the full co-operation of my delegation.
2.	May I also take this opportunity to extend our congratulations to Mr. Lazar Mojsov of Yugoslavia, the President of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly, for the excellent manner in which he handled the responsibilities of his high office. During his tenure of office the Assembly held a number of sessions at which important decisions were taken. We are all indebted to him for his inspiring leadership.
3.	Our Secretary-General continues to enjoy our admiration for his relentless search for a just, equal and hate-free world in which all States and peoples will live in peace and harmony on the basis of interdependence. Nigeria is encouraged by his dedication to the fulfilment of these hopes and aspirations in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations. We are convinced that he will continue to enrich the Organization in his leadership role.
4.	We seize this opportunity to welcome among us the new of Solomon Islands. We congratulate the leaders of new State. We hope that the United Nations, and in particular its specialized agencies, will assist the new State and thus enable it to consolidate its independence.
5.	At the same time, we regret that, almost 18 years after the overwhelming adoption by the General Assembly in its resolution 1514 (XV) of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, some States remain under colonial domination. All peoples of the world, regardless of race, colour or religion, should by now have been able to exorcise their inalienable right to self-determination, freedom and independence.
6.	The General Assembly cannot justifiably claim that it has fulfilled the hopes and yearnings of the founding fathers of the Organization. We recall that they did 'reaffirm faith in... the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small'.
7.	We are at a crossroads. The question is, Where do we go from here? The signposts are clear: to disaster and chaos; or to peace, security and co-operation.
8.	Fortunately, the lessons of history are abundant and dynamic. The options have always been there. The choice should now have become clear. Mere hope is transient, while existing fears by a few appear precisely articulated. The divisive consequences of the extant concept of three worlds are real but they are redeemable. We can march together, like soldiers on parade, even though sometimes we are out of step one with another.
9.	Equality and equity should therefore be the dynamic instruments for change and direction. Our goals should be peace and prosperity for all based on universal and mutual confidence; their attainment demands an enlightened modification of self-perpetuating national goals and policies. These modifications will, no doubt, pose severe challenges to the dedication of all nations, large and small, weak and strong, to the objectives of the Charter of the United Nations.

10.	During the past year important strides have been taken. The General Assembly concluded three special sessions on major issues ranging from peace-keeping and decolonization to the attempt to achieve a new world without war. In addition, two global conferences were convened within the framework of the United Nations further to arouse the conscience of mankind against racism and racial discrimination. A third set out to mobilize the capacities of developing countries for collective self- reliance. Those gatherings were designed to steer humanity 
towards a better world. The United Nations today continues to provide the flywheel for a forward movement in that direction. Our faith in the United Nations' ability to light the way so that we can see our path clearly is total and complete.
11.	My delegation observes with concern the vicissitudes experienced in our efforts to establish a New International Economic Order. We in Nigeria fully appreciate the enormity of the real development problems facing developing countries. There is clear evidence that these problems are, in fact, getting worse and are threatening stability, order and good government in some countries.
12.	It has been claimed that the countries of the world are making their best efforts within the bounds of existing national socio-economic constraints. But it is also true that there are now at hand the economic and technological means in the world to end the progressive and definitely controllable drift to chaos in international economic relations.
13.	That suggests that abject poverty and its effects on the quality of life of the peoples in developing countries can and should be effectively attacked globally. It should become the priority issue requiring international action that is sufficiently responsive to the needs of the developing countries as determined by them on the basis of mutuality of interests.
14.	The tragic paradox of unmitigated want in the midst of increasing affluence in developed countries has been recognized. It has even provided the motive force for the spontaneous expression of generalized goodwill concerning the establishment of the New International Economic Order. In the view of my delegation, that is not enough. Developing countries need more than mere commitments. They want a' fundamental change in the structure of international economic relations. They want effective participation in the decision-making processes, particularly as regards international economic negotiations on all issues bearing on the New International Economic Order. They reiterate that these negotiations should be conducted within the framework of the United Nations system. In short, they want a clear voice in the decisions that affect the management of the world economy.
15.	I have dwelt advisedly on the need for discussions and negotiations on the fundamental issues of the New International Economic Order because the alternative is confrontation, which is divisive and may not be results- oriented. Mere palliatives, along the traditional lines of donor and recipient, not only are peripheral to the structural economic problems of developing countries, but also inhibit their self-reliance and sustained growth. These negotiations, therefore, should not degenerate into seminar-type sessions inconclusive in nature and replete with frustrations.
16.	It is in this context that my delegation feels gravely concerned at the apparent difficulties which have not allowed the Committee on the' establishment of the New International Economic Order, the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, which was adopted unanimously, to settle down to its business of negotiating, through discussions, concrete action-oriented decisions on global issues to bring about an orderly improvement in the structure of the world economy.
17.	My delegation feels that all the outstanding obstacles to the effective mobilization of the full potential of that Committee should be removed at this current session. Accordingly we urge all countries to co-operate in ensuring that agreement is reached when the matter is considered after the conclusion of the general debate. We fear that unless that is done the authority of the General Assembly could be severely eroded.
18.	It seems that there were some silver linings mentioned in the statements of some delegations more directly involved in the development of international co-operation bearing on the New International Economic Order. I also hope that those expressions of intent will be translated into concrete proposals to promote negotiations on the establishment of the New International Economic Order. In relation to this question, we feel that the ongoing dialogue between the centrally planned and market economy countries in Europe will generate the necessary commitments of all parties to it in order to ensure the active participation of every industrialized country in Europe in major global negotiations bearing on developments and international economic co-operation in accordance with the Declaration and Programme of Action cm the New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)].
19.	We note with regret that certain developed countries are contemplating unilateral legislation affecting the exploration and exploitation of the deep sea-bed beyond the national jurisdiction of Member States. That would certainly be a violation of United Nations General Assembly resolution 2749 (XXV) in which this Assembly solemnly declared, inter alia: 'The sea-bed and ocean floor, and the subsoil... as well as the resources of the area, are the common heritage of mankind.' We join the Group of 77 in appealing to those concerned to respect the wishes of the majority of mankind on that particular issue.
20.	The first special session of the General Assembly on disarmament that was ever held marked a new stage in the efforts of the United Nations to save mankind from self-destruction. That session was convened because of the arms race and the development and deployment of new weapons of mass destruction.
21.	Military research and development in the nuclear- weapon States continue to consume vast human and financial resources. We' note the competing reaction among nuclear-weapon States in order to achieve nuclear parity. This locks up funds which otherwise would have been used for development. As stated in the Final Document of the special session [resolution S-10/2], disarmament has clearly become an imperative and most urgent task facing the international community. The United Nations, therefore, must be in vanguard of efforts towards general and complete disarmament.
22.	In this regard we welcome the decision of the special session to establish the United Nations Disarmament Commission. We are happy that this new Commission will be a deliberative body and a subsidiary organ of the General Assembly, and will consider and make recommendations on various problems in the field of disarmament. We hope that it will provide viable follow-up machinery for the decisions and recommendations of the special session devoted to disarmament.
23.	My delegation is also encouraged that the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament has now, in effect, been streamlined and democratized. We are glad that the institution of co-chairmanship that has in the past caused irritation has now, by unanimous decision, been discarded. I am happy that, like France, all other countries will now find the stage more propitious for participating in the new Committee on Disarmament. It is also our hope that the ambiguities in the language of the Final Document of the special session concerning the Committee on Disarmament will not create any problems and that the procedure of decision by consensus will not hamper the decision-making process and inhibit progress.
24.	It is in this light that my delegation looks forward to the early implementation of the Programme of Action [resolution S-10/2, sect. Ill], so that the options presented and the enthusiasm generated by the special session will not be whittled away. It is our hope that an early conclusion of an agreement at the second series of the Strategic Arms limitation Talks would give impetus to the new disarmament programme.
25.	The issue of the universal protection and enjoyment of human rights has become so emotive and embroiled in East-West confrontations as to becloud the real essence of the role of the United Nations in this regard.
26.	Viewing the issue from this standpoint, the Nigerian delegation will neither seek nor participate in purely political interpretations of the concept of human rights. Rather, we shall actively join hands with other countries in arriving at a workable arrangement, whereby General Assembly resolution 32/130 would be accorded the central position it should occupy in all the deliberations on this issue in the Third Committee. We shall also continue to support new efforts to strengthen the United Nations' capacity for the promotion and protection of human rights at national and regional levels.
27.	In the Middle East, despite all efforts and some new elements, real peace still eludes the region. The situation in the region, for a mixture of compelling reasons, vitally affects not only international peace and security, but the interests of the world community as a whole. There appears to be no respite from the mounting wave of the violence that has plagued the entire region for more than three decades.
28.	Turning to the Camp David accords,  my delegation welcomes all initiatives in the direction of peace. All the same, we must remember that what we have is a framework, and that the road to final peace is still both long and arduous. However, I wish to emphasize the fact that the
United Nations over the years has established broad principles for a resolution of the Middle East problem. These include Israel's unconditional and total withdrawal from Arab lands occupied in the June 1967 war, in accordance with relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and, more particularly, resolutions 242(1967) and 338 (1973) of the Security Council. Any solution must also take into consideration the inalienable rights of all Palestinians—I repeat, all Palestinians—to self-determination and independence within recognized borders of their own.
29.	In short, our goal will be to find a comprehensive solution that will obtain broad support from all peoples directly concerned so that, in the end, we do not merely exchange another Middle East war for a dangerous escalation in tension or, indeed, an increasingly violent situation of 'no war, no peace' brought about by the failure of the international community to solve the Palestinian problem.
30.	The major area of serious concern to my delegation is southern Africa. The situation in Zimbabwe is still very explosive. Since the thirty-second session, we have witnessed fresh steps taken by the rebel leader, Ian Smith, further to consolidate his illegal regime.
31.	Early this year the rebels established a so-called multiracial transitional administration in preparation for majority rule. Yet the hardships and sufferings of the majority African population continue. Indeed, the brutal killing of defenceless Zimbabweans has not abated. Smith explains away these killings and other related atrocities by his notorious Selous Scouts as casualties resulting from 'cross-fire' or breaches of curfew. At the same time, the acts of aggression against independent African States have been stepped up.
32.	We state once again that no solution of the Rhodesian problem will bring lasting peace unless it has the support of all the principal parties to the conflict. They must include, in particular, the Patriotic Front, which has borne the brunt of the struggle for majority rule.
33.	An arrangement that seeks to hand over power to black surrogates of white minority rule is doomed to fail. Only simpletons or people without any interest in genuine independence for Zimbabwe can give support to this fraud.
34.	We support those who believe that an all-party conference holds out the last, best hope for securing a peaceful settlement. However, there is clear evidence of deliberate sabotage of such a conference by the illegal regime of Ian Smith. In the past few weeks, there has been an intensification of mass arrests and the disappearance of hundreds of the supporters of the Patriotic Front. The nationalist forces, however, continue to break the backbone of rebel resistance. Together with the front-line States, we have been working on borrowed time to ensure that the end-result will not be to divide the country into camps of victors and vanquished. We envisage a settlement acceptable to all the elements central to the issue. We remain convinced that an all-party conference could provide the best forum for resolving outstanding differences so as to pave the way to genuine democratic rule.
35.	In this regard, it is a matter of grave concern to the Nigerian delegation that some members of the United
States Congress have thought it fit to invite the leader of the rebel regime to appear before the Congress on the issue of majority rule in Zimbabwe. It is well known that past Anglo-American attempts to convene an all-party conference have been frustrated by the recalcitrant attitude of Ian Smith and his clique. Unfortunately, this invitation will be used by Ian Smith and his supporters in Congress to promote the internal settlement and also to whip up sentiments both in Congress and among the American public for the possible lifting of the sanctions imposed by the United Nations on the rebel regime. It would be tragic if this invitation to Ian Smith should be the first in a chain of events that can lead only to the escalation of the conflict with the consequent tragic loss of lives.
36.	I now turn to Namibia. The international community is once again faced with the intransigence of the Pretoria regime, which continues to maintain its illegal presence in that Territory.
37.	After 18 months of intensive negotiations, we have taken decisive action, as is evident from the adoption by the Security Council of resolution 435 (1978). We congratulate the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPQJ for exercising restraint and for its co-operation. We hope the five Western Powers who initiated the plan for a settlement  will continue to give full support to the Secretary-General for the implementation of the settlement proposals in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and within the context of the norms of resolution 385 (1976) of the Security Council.
38.	The fact that I have highlighted matters of concern to my delegation, mainly in the Middle East and southern Africa, should not be construed as showing a lack of sensitivity on our part in respect of other areas of tension in the world. In Cyprus, for example, we remain concerned that the presence of foreign troops, in violation of the territorial integrity of the country, still persists in spite of resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. We deplore all manoeuvres by outsiders to divide the country and we demand the unconditional withdrawal of all alien forces to permit genuine reconciliation between the two major communities on the island.
39.	Similarly, we call on all peace-loving countries in the world, and especially those that have the requisite political leverage on Guatemala, to use their influence and persuade Guatemala to comply with resolution 31/50 of 1 December 1976 by allowing Belize to proceed to independence in security, with its territorial integrity intact.
40.	To us in Nigeria, and I believe to all people of African descent and all freedom-loving nations of the world, the situation in the southern part of our continent, especially in South Africa, is a festering sore. It is a constant reminder of the indignity and inhumanity to which the black man has been subjected. It has its roots in colonialism. It is sustained by political and economic interests from outside the continent. It reflects the pervasive nature of racism in the world. The central theme of the problem of southern Africa is apartheid. The culprit is the racist regime in Pretoria.
41.	The World Conference for Action Against Apartheid, held at Lagos in 1977, was a watershed in international action against apartheid. Its success resounded the world over. It instilled new hopes in the hearts of the oppressed. Yet barely one year later, at the World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination in Geneva, the international community failed to give the struggle greater dimensions. I must here express the dissatisfaction of my delegation at the outcome of the Geneva Conference. Indeed, its results seem a set-back to the accomplishment of the Lagos Conference. One would have thought that the Western countries  which pulled out of the Geneva Conference, would have appreciated the scope and importance of the broader issues of racism and racial discrimination and their grave consequences throughout the world, in particular in southern Africa. Their action cannot but give Pretoria solace. It allows an impression to be created that Pretoria has strong supporters.
42.	We in Nigeria are convinced that the longer the racist regime in Pretoria exists, the more grave and bloody the racial conflagration will be. We believe that increased and continuous pressure must always be brought to bear on Pretoria, whether on the battlefield or in international forums. It is our belief, first, that South Africa should be further isolated in all—and I stress 'all'—areas of international endeavour; secondly, that South Africa should be treated as a culprit and not as a partner in any negotiation aimed at resolving the problems of southern Africa; thirdly, that as a matter of extreme urgency the Security Council should impose, as a minimum, sanctions on new loans to and investments in South Africa, and thereafter impose full and mandatory economic sanctions; and fourthly, that the international community should step up assistance to the national liberation movement in South Africa.
43.	For its part, Nigeria will be unrelenting in its support for the oppressed people of South Africa. We shall continue to give diplomatic, political, financial and material assistance to the national liberation movement. We shall continue to press for the isolation of South Africa and its allies and friends in all international forums. As for the people of Nigeria, their concern for the oppressed is reflected in their continued and generous donations to our national relief fund for southern Africa.
44.	It would be difficult for me to conclude this statement without recalling some of the tragic events that took place on our continent during the past year. There were, to say the least, crude attempts by neo-colonialist forces at the recolonization of Africa, in the guise of humanitarianism. Those blatant attempt's led to considerable loss of life and - property and have demonstrated to a great extent the weakness inherent in individual African countries, which is being exploited to the limit by those who wish us no good.'
45.	I cannot reflect this better than by referring to a portion of the statement which my Head of State, Lieutenant General Olusegun Obasanjo, made at the fifteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] in Khartoum in July of this year:
'Let me at the outset reiterate Nigeria's position on the question of external intervention in the affairs of any
sovereign nation. We condemn all such interventions without reservation.
'We are, however, of the view that we need to be quite clear about what we mean by external intervention in the context of contemporary political developments in Africa. Typical examples of the kind of foreign interference we have in mind and which I believe were foreseen by the OAU Charter were the criminal mercenary-led aggressions against the Republic of Guinea in 1970, the externally organized invasion of the Republic of Benin in January last year and the recent foreign mercenary take-over of the Government of the Comoro Islands. These were operations purposely mounted in order to protect foreign interests and to subvert the stability and sovereignty of specific African States. Unless we wish to indulge in self-deception by avoiding unpalatable truths, we should recognize the recent intervention by certain ex-colonial European Powers in Central Africa for what it really was. Simply put, it is a most naked and unashamed attempt to determine what Africa's true collective interests should be. We reject the notion that Africa's interests or collective security needs can be discussed or determined by the Western nations or anybody else for that matter without our consent or without consultation with delegations mandated by the OAU'.
It is my hope that those events will not be repeated in future.



















1979

It gives me great pride and pleasure to congratulate the President on his unanimous election and to say that my delegation fully concurs in the highest praise and admiration, which all delegations, without exception, have expressed for his competence and achievement as President of this Assembly. He is an illustrious son of Africa and comes from the sister United Republic of Tanzania, which has never hesitated to be in the vanguard of the just struggle of our people for freedom and independence. Bearing in mind his personal contributions as Chairman of the Special Committee on decolonization, my delegation pledges to support him fully in the performance of his onerous functions and responsibilities.
77.	May I also express our congratulations and gratitude to his worthy predecessor, Mr. Indalecio Lievano of Colombia, for his impeccable record as President of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly.
78.	Over the years, our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, has in the name of our Organization, managed the endless, crises of our age with dedication, compassion and perseverance. The fact that nations tend to judge the successes of the United Nations by his successes is the measure of the hope and confidence we all place in his office. I pay a very warm tribute to him for all his efforts.
79.	The vision of the founding fathers of the United Nations was eventual universality of membership. With the accession of Saint Lucia to independence and its admission to the United Nations as the one hundred and fifty-second Member State, our Organization is fast approaching its goal of universality. On behalf of Nigeria, I most warmly welcome the membership of Saint Lucia, with which Nigeria shares many bonds as a result of Commonwealth membership and history. It is our desire to maintain cordial relations of friendship and close co-operation with Saint Lucia.
80.	Only a few weeks ago, we all learned with shock and grief of the death of Agostinho Neto, the President of Angola. During the lifetime of that towering architect of Angola's freedom and independence, my country enjoyed fraternal relations with his Government and people. We shared his aspirations and his dreams for his country and Africa. His death has deprived Africa and the entire world of a wise, erudite and humane statesman. We shall all miss his candour and unswerving commitment to the vision of a just international order.
81.	Permit me to say how happy and honoured I am to convey to this Assembly the personal greetings and good wishes of Alhaji Shehu Usman Aliyu Shagari, the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Nigeria, I also take special satisfaction and pride in addressing the Assembly at this major turning-point in Nigeria's history.
82.	After 13 years of military rule in Nigeria, we have just concluded a unique experiment of orderly and peaceful transition to a democratically-elected, civilian Government. Last July and August, my compatriots in six weeks went to the polls in five separate national elections to fill 19 state assemblies, the Federal House of Representatives and the National Senate, in addition to electing 19 state governors, and finally the President of our country. All these elections, which were conducted peacefully and in a free, open manner, marked a significant milestone in my country's political and constitutional history,
83.	On Monday, I October 1979, the former head of the Federal Military Government, Commander-in- Chief of the Armed Forces of Nigeria, General Oluse-gun Obasanjo, formally handed over power to the new President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in a solemn ceremony at the Tafawa Balewa Square, Lagos, the same site where the rebirth of our nation was consecrated nearly two decades ago. The moral impact and, I daresay, the political significance of the ceremony cannot be exaggerated.
84.	Nations, like men and women, sometimes make mistakes. This is regrettable. But it is more regrettable when they miss the opportunity to make history. The Armed Forces of Nigeria have made history because they have lived up their honour and duty. They took up the sword to defend and preserve our national integrity and sovereignty, which was threatened in 1966. They pledged to hand over power to a civilian Government, democratically elected and freely inaugurated, once the constitutional arrangements had come into effect. They have lived up to this expectation. Given this tradition and precedent of peaceful and orderly transition from military to civilian Government, Nigeria is today not only irreversibly united as a nation, but completely at one and at peace with itself. Not only have we solved our problems of divisions and secessions—legacies of a colonialism whose sole raison d’être was to pit brother against brother in order to consolidate its exploitative stranglehold—but we have also embarked on an honourable national course that fully respects and promotes all human, social, economic and political rights of every citizen, regardless of race, colour, creed or sex. Above all, we are committed to the simple precept that independence is nothing but the government of the people by themselves. Thus, with their tasks accomplished, the armed forces of Nigeria have now proudly marched back to the barracks of their own volition to perform their traditional role of defending our fatherland against external aggression.
85.	New Governments tend to address all issues at the same time. Mine is no exception. But we have the advantage of hindsight, perspective and continuity. This is because the cardinal principles of my country's foreign policy have their roots as deep in the genius of our people as in the history and circumstances of our country and continent. We are proud that many nations and peoples identify with these principles.
86.	Those who speculate that our new civilian Government will be less dynamic in the pursuit of our foreign policy objectives will be disillusioned. If anything, and because we shall be operating from a firm foundation, we intend to pursue them with greater drive and greater vigour. Let me therefore emphasize that the quintessence of Nigeria's foreign policy has been, and will remain, the pursuit of international peace and security; strict non-alignment; international solidarity and adherence to the principles and purposes of the Charters of the United Nations and of the OAU; the protection and defence of human dignity; constructive partnership in the campaign for the enjoyment by all states of equitable economic and political rights; an unswerving commitment to the total liberation of Africa; and the eradication from southern Africa of the twin evils of colonialism and apartheid.
87.	Naturally, we shall give primacy to the pursuit of peace and security in Africa, without which we can neither be safe nor prosper. In this connexion, my Government condemns most vigorously recent interferences by some European countries, notably France, in the internal affairs of some African countries. Like the Bourbons of old, they have clearly proved that they have learned nothing, and forgotten nothing. Leadership in any State is as good as the people of that State want it to be. Those African leaders who parody themselves after foreign models or who degrade themselves by exploiting their people through insensitivity, corruption or callous brutality will be swept away by their own people into the dust-bin of history, just as their colonial masters were driven out of Africa in ignominy and revulsion. It is only the leadership which grows out of the people that will endure. In recognition of this fact, the OAU long ago affirmed as one of its cardinal principles the 'unreserved condemnation, in all its forms, of political assassination as well as of subversive activities on the part of neighbouring States or any other State'. The era of self-appointed kingmakers for Africa is gone. Africa will no longer tolerate intervention and destabilization exercises in the continent. Dependence of political institutions on foreigners from whatever continent is both anathema and a betrayal of Africa's freedom and liberty.
88.	Africa stood on the eve of the 1960s proud and defiant. The promise of independence was vibrant and challenging. If the dream in some cases turned into a nightmare, the fault does not lie on our stars. While we derive no consolation from the fact that no country anywhere in the world has a more glorious account of its first 20 years of history to give than those of most independent African States, and while our detractors must bear in mind that the stresses and changes which have unsettled all nations, developed and developing alike, were bound to take their toll more on the new nations of Africa, it is reasonable to state that, given its enormous resources and potential, Africa has not been left alone to develop its own institutions and to provide for its well-being, as others were allowed to at the comparable stage of their history. Former colonial masters not only left behind time-bombs in the form of latent instability and insurrection, but, nurturing their nostalgias and myths of indispensability, they carefully planned their return for insidious political domination and economic exploitation. In fact, it may be true to say that the colonialists never left Africa. They merely exchanged their roles and masks to make their presence less suspect and objectionable.
89.	But as we meet on the eve of the 1980s, let no one assume that Africa has not learned its lesson. Those States which profess genuine friendship for Africa must come to terms with a new relationship with that continent. Africa is for the Africans. It is not for sale, nor for division into spheres of influence. We want no dependent status, nor surrogate roles. We seek external economic aid and assistance, fully conscious of our dignity and inalienable rights. Let all foreign Powers recognize that. Whatever they can do for us now can never compensate for the debt they owe Africa, directly or indirectly.
90.	One area in which we intend in Nigeria to subject to the acid test all professions of friendship by each and every State for Africa is in southern Africa. The rabid racism which apartheid represents to all men of conscience; the inhuman exploitation of man by man, unprecedented in the annals of man since the slave trade of the eighteenth century, which apartheid constitutes; the grotesque dehumanization of an entire people which apartheid has institutionalized; the systematic and massive violation of human rights which apartheid promotes, and the blatant and consistent destruction of life which it encourages—all these and more make apartheid a crime against humanity. That a minority racist regime in a country which has no claims to be a world Power can defy the United Nations at will has ominous implications for the survival of our Organization. How else can one judge the efficacy of the international will, if the United Nations cannot implement its decisions arrived at unanimously and in accordance with the provisions of its Charter? What recourses there for the peaceful resolution of the problems of southern Africa, when South Africa, in violation of international law, bombs refugee camps and invades the territory of neighbouring countries in naked pursuit of a policy of aggression, intimidation, and terrorism?
91.	Nigeria has been following closely Zimbabwe's progress to full independence. The colonial Power, the United Kingdom, has recognized, albeit belatedly, that it has to negotiate with the Patriotic Front of Zimbabwe for the transfer of power to the people of Zimbabwe, if the hope for a just and durable settlement in Zimbabwe is to be realized. From all accounts so far, the contributions of the Patriotic Front, under the leadership of Joshua Nkomo and Robert Mugabe, to the current Rhodesia Constitutional Conference in London have been constructive, imaginative and most helpful. It is Nigeria's hope that justice and realism will prevail, and that the London talks will restore power and sovereignty to the Zimbabwean peoples on a basis which will justify international acceptance and recognition. Otherwise, international sanctions against the illegal regime must continue, and the armed struggle for freedom and independence, under the leadership of the Patriotic Front, will be intensified.
92.	The situation in Namibia is no less intolerable. Early this year, we had hoped that the plans of the Security Council for Namibia's transition to independence would be implemented. Events have belied that hope. Instead of progress, the United Nations now seems to have allowed itself to be lulled into inaction. In my delegation's judgement, there has been too much bending over backwards to accommodate the so-called Government of South Africa that is in illegal occupation of the Territory of Namibia. And not enough is being done to assist SWAPO and the people of Namibia to regain their independence. In strict terms of international law, morality or natural justice, the United Nations should not put itself in a position of appearing to condone an illegal and illegitimate act of piracy by a State which has forfeited the goodwill and respect of the international community.
93.	The United Nations Charter brooks no double standards. There is no ambiguity regarding how it should deal with errant Member States. It was in recognition of this that the last session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU, held in Monrovia, called upon the United Nations to invoke the provisions of Chapter VII, in its entirety, against South Africa over Namibia. Nigeria is committed to press for the implementation of that decision.
94.	Behind all these problems of southern Africa is the racist minority regime of South Africa, whose conduct now raises the spectre of a racial war in our continent. South Africa continues to be emboldened it its intransigence by its supporters and friends, particularly in the Western bloc, who make a ritual of condemning its apartheid policies, while they increase their trade, investments, arms and technological transfers, as well as their assistance in the development of nuclear capability, with its regime. Perhaps the time has come for the United Nations to undertake a comprehensive study of how much the attitude of some Western States is determined by their dependence on the strategic minerals and commodities of South Africa. We shall initiate the necessary studies in due course. Further, as internal and international opposition to its policies intensifies, it is painfully obvious that South Africa intends, through the employment of mercenaries and subversion, to threaten the peace and security of our continent, In the past year alone, the OAU has had to adopt two urgent resolutions calling attention to the menace of mercenaries and requesting that its convention against mercenaries be reinforced to deal effectively with the problem. Nigeria therefore intends, in co-operation with its African sister countries, and countries such as Barbados, to submit formal proposals for an international convention to ban the recruitment and activities of mercenaries in Africa and throughout the world.
95.	The situation in the Middle East continues to pose a very serious threat to international peace and security, For too long has that region, whose ties with Africa are as intimate as they are eternal, has been the tinder- box of hostilities and the cockpit of wars, with the accompanying defilement of its populations. We firmly believe in a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East question in which peace and justice triumph together. We cannot therefore but remind the protagonists of any peace initiative in the region that the question of Palestine and the rights of its people remain at the core of the continuing crisis in the Middle East and that, unless this central issue is addressed fully and directly, no just and durable solution to the crisis should be expected.
96.	As Nigeria has had cause to state before, the relationship between the problem of the Middle East and the question of Palestine is integral, both in its consideration and in its solution. Consequently, partial treaties and partial agreements will not suffice. The Palestinians, in common with all of us, have a God- given, inalienable right to a national homeland. They must achieve independence with full sovereignty. They must not be held hostages to the security or boundary considerations of any State in the region.
97.	We therefore call again upon Israel to withdraw from Arab lands occupied since June 1967. We call upon Israel to desist from building new settlements in the occupied Arab lands and to stop administrative and other measures designed to alter the demographic and cultural character of the occupied lands in violation of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949. We recognize the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinians. We re-emphasize that Arab Jerusalem is an integral part of the occupied West Bank, which must be liberated.
98.	The harrowing experience and suffering in Lebanon oblige us to emphasize the need for an early and viable peace in the Middle East. It is unimaginable that the United Nations should appear to be so impotent in the face of persistent attempts by Israel to undermine a United Nations peace-keeping operation in a beleaguered Member State. The United Nations should evolve a more strict and practical solution with a view to ensuring the integrity of the Lebanese nation and to guarantee the right of its peoples to live in their traditional peace and freedom.
99.	The mandate of UNIFIL to secure the return of the Lebanese Government's authority to southern Lebanon must be fulfilled. As a country contributing to that Force, Nigeria fully endorses the view that an adequate security zone must be established around UNIFIL headquarters, that the renegade Haddad's forces must end their harassment of the UNIFIL troops and that over-all co-operation of all parties concerned must be forthcoming. In addition, Nigeria expects that a more determined effort will be made to remove all the obstacles in the way of UNIFIL; for instance, all Member States must share its prescriptive obligations. It is our hope that delegations will not demur at making their contributions to the upkeep of UNIFIL and in extending it their full co-operation in its complex and delicate task.
100.	Another issue which must be addressed in this connexion is the continued harassment by the Israeli authorities in the form of arrests and trials of members of UNIFIL. This raises the question of whether the time has not come for the United Nations to enunciate more precise norms and rules in a convention defining the status and immunities of United Nations peacekeeping troops as international civil servants not subject to capricious blackmail and harassment by a national government. I am aware that there are various peace-keeping agreements relating to this matter, but they all differ. Perhaps the Special Committee on Peace-Keeping Operations, of which I have the privilege of being the Chairman, may be directed to consider the need for an instrument that would establish standard and uniform rights, obligations and immunities for peace-keeping personnel.
101.	Many years ago, when UNFICYP was set up, with its double mandate for peace-keeping and peacemaking, it was hoped that it would play the decisive role in ensuring the return of tranquillity to Cyprus and thereby assist in upholding the principles of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of that country, with which Nigeria has close ties of friendship. Just as the stalemate in the intervening years, exacerbated by the tragic events of 1974, has remained a matter of grave concern to Nigeria, so also was the failure to build upon the ten-point agreement reached after the Secretary-General's personal intervention last May. Nigeria believes that the various decisions and resolutions of the United Nations, as well as those of the Conferences of non-aligned countries, provide a basis for a just peace.
102.	At the end of its eighth session recently, we learned with relief that the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has entered its final stages, and that it is scheduled to end next year. The fact that the negotiations have been protracted and difficult should steel us in our determination to ensure that the convention to be adopted will bequeath to future generations a peaceful regime for the exploitation of the sea. The exploitation of the sea and its resources must be fair and rational.
103.	One of the most serious crises facing mankind today is the chaotic state of the world economic situation. There is an ominous indication that the poor developing countries beset by the difficulties of underdevelopment, natural disasters, inflation, unemployment and exchange-rate fluctuations, among others, are being made to subsidize the rich industrialized nations through structural and institutional defects in the world economic system. We had expected that dispassionate discussion of economic matters within the context of dialogues between the developing and the developed countries would have removed these anomalies.
104.	We note with deep regret that the economic negotiations held so far this year have been most disappointing. At the Fourth Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77, held in Arusha in February, the developing countries agreed on a programme of collective self- reliance, in which great hopes were placed. That was to have been the basis for realistic negotiations between the developed and developing countries at the fifth session of UNCTAD in Manila. Unfortunately, instead of addressing the main issues facing the economy of the international community, the Conference concentrated on matters of secondary importance, and wasted precious time on trying to sow division and discord in the ranks of the developing countries. Similarly, the Tokyo Round on multilateral trade negotiations, which was h6ld in Geneva within the framework of GATT, ended by protecting only the interests of the developed industrialized countries. We hope that the recent agreement on the constitution of UNIDO as a specialized agency, the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development and the decision to convene a special session of the General Assembly in 1980, in order to assess the progress made in the various forums of the United Nations system in establishing the New International Economic Order will remedy some of these short-comings.
105.	The goal which the developing countries have set for themselves is the restructuring of international economic relations in a way which would accelerate the narrowing of the ever-widening gap between the developed and the developing countries, through trade and aid, and increased net flows of real resources. To this end they wish to initiate measures that will enable them to deal with their mass poverty, mass unemployment and galloping food deficits. In response, the developed countries have merely demonstrated their hesitation, if not lack of political will, in achieving the desired goal of establishing the New International Economic Order. There is no gainsaying that the struggle to eliminate the inequities of the existing international economic system and to establish the New International Economic Order is an integral part of the struggle for the elimination of colonialism, foreign exploitation and all forms of subjugation and interference in the internal affairs of States. It is against that background that Nigeria fully endorses the new strategy adopted at the Sixth Conference of non-aligned countries in Havana to strengthen mutual co-operation among the developing countries, and to begin international negotiations within the framework of the United Nations on all the social and economic problems facing the international community.
106.	The economies of many rich, industrialized countries were built and nurtured on the availability of cheap petroleum, to the detriment of the oil-producing countries. However, since they have succeeded in establishing quite satisfactory pricing mechanisms in conformity with the dictates of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, the members of OPEC are being cast in the role of scapegoats. They are being blamed for virtually all the economic difficulties in the world, from inflation to the artificially manipulated price of gold. It is very strange that those who speak lightly of the subject have not stopped to consider seriously what component of international inflation is contributed by oil. It is even stranger that they have not questioned why each of the industrialized countries with economies that work, like Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany, hold far greater foreign reserves than all the OPEC countries put together.
107.	Nigeria fully appreciates the plight of the developing countries, particularly the least developed, a majority of which are in Africa. We admit that recent increases in the price of oil have aggravated their hardships. But oil is only a part of the problem. We need to consider carefully and collectively relevant solutions to the global issues of raw materials, development, finance and energy. And this must be done soberly and with full comprehension. The challenge we all of us face collectively is how to evolve during the next United Nations development decade rational procedures for the utilization of the world's shrinking natural resources, bearing in mind, of course, the crying needs of the developing countries.
108.	It is superficial to speak of the inherent contradictions and distortions in the world economic system which militate against the poor nations without referring to the disproportionate resources being consumed by armaments, particularly nuclear armaments. Every nuclear test—and there were over 250 nuclear tests in the past year alone—blights the hopes and aspirations of over 1 million children for education and health care. The annual unproductive expenditure of $400 billion on armaments far exceeds five times the total net flow of resources to developing countries as a whole from all sources, which stood at $63.93 billion in 1977. In fact, it is more than half of the combined gross domestic product of all the developing countries together. Viewed from another angle, the least developed countries of the world had a total outstanding external debt of $10 billion, and as a result had to mortgage 15 per cent of their export earnings in that year for debt payments. How relieved they could have been—what a prospect for a fresh economic start they could have had—if one fortieth of 1 per cent of the annual armaments budget of the nuclear-weapon States had been diverted to cancel out their external debts.
109.	Another illustration will show how resources which could have brought stability and development to some region of the world, say Africa, are being frittered away in the production of nuclear armaments that no one dares to use. The 49 independent African States have with the approval of the United Nations launched a Transport and Communications Decade in Africa, which, they hope, will enable them to integrate their economies and provide a viable basis for accelerated progress. The programme is estimated to cost $8 billion over 10 years. The Powers that do not hesitate to budget $400 billion for destructive purposes are wary of supporting and making pledges for such a constructive scheme as Africa's Transport and Communications Decade.
110.	In consideration of these facts, Nigeria had fervently hoped that the text of a comprehensive test-ban treaty between three of the nuclear-weapon States would have been submitted for consideration at this session, as promised. It is a matter of deep regret and concern that once again we are being asked to accept their word on trust. It is also because we believe in the existence of an organic link between disarmament and development that we have over the years supported all moves for the elimination of nuclear weapons during the first Disarmament Decade and, failing that, the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones, particularly in Africa. Hence also our proposal two years ago that perhaps through fellowship grants and enhanced dissemination of public information mankind could be made more aware of the dangers of nuclear weapons and of their debilitating effects on the world economy. And hence we also welcome the agreement reached at the second round of SALT, for that agreement only makes sense because it puts a ceiling on the probable amount of resources that could be burnt up in a mindless nuclear arms race.
111.	The dangers we face as we enter the 1980s are too real for us to despair. Beset as mankind is, on the one hand, by economic burdens and, on the other, by fear of a nuclear holocaust, constructive and collective action through the United Nations remains the only hope and opportunity we have to face the challenges of the future. Only thus can we leave a legacy worthy of our civilization to our children, as we meet to consider their prospects and problems in this International Year of the Child.





1980
Mr. President, the General Assembly is meeting for its thirty-fifth session as storm clouds which threaten the future of mankind gather over the international horizon. It gives me great confidence and hope that the task of presiding over the affairs of the General Assembly at this momentous time has been entrusted to someone of your integrity, experience and wisdom. Accept, therefore, my warmest congratulations. Your election is also an acknowledgement of the high respect and admiration which the international community has for your great country, the Federal Republic of Germany, with which my country enjoys most cordial and friendly relations. I am sure that under your wise guidance the Assembly will achieve great success at this session.
3.	The past year has been remarkable for the many intractable international crises which the Organization has had to deal with. It is a matter of particular pride to Africa that our predecessor was Ambassador Salim Ahmed Salim from the sister State of the United Republic of Tanzania. Not only did he preside over the thirty-fourth session with a sure and confident hand, Ambassador Salim also had the rare distinction of presiding over three special sessions of the General Assembly. We pay him the highest praise and offer him our felicitations.
4.	I should also like to address a special word of praise and admiration to our distinguished Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim. His untiring exertions and imaginative initiatives have become the measure of the successes of the Organization. His reassuring presence was immensely felt at the second extraordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OA U\, the first economic summit meeting, which was held last April at Lagos. His frequent visits to Africa have enabled him not only to share moments of history with us but also to endear himself to Africa in a very personal and special way.
5.	It is with great pride and satisfaction that, on behalf of the Government and people of Nigeria, I extend the heartiest welcome to the new sister State of Zimbabwe in our ranks. Few events can match the joy, drama and impact of the independence of Zimbabwe. I salute my brother, Prime Minister Robert Mugabe, and all his compatriots for their courage, heroism and magnanimity. Their victory demonstrates clearly that the will of a determined people can never be permanently suppressed. It proves beyond doubt that a determined people fighting for a just cause and dedicated to the recovery of its right will ultimately triumph, no matter how formidable the odds against it. Our brothers and sisters in Zimbabwe have proved to the world the truth of the old adage that 'the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the will of the victims of tyranny'.
6.	Nigeria, Africa, and indeed the entire international community, can take justifiable pride in the independence of Zimbabwe. It has coincided with the end of the second decade of the struggle against colonialism and against exploitation. Since 1960, when the General Assembly adopted resolution 1514 (XV) containing the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, it has never relented in its efforts to support the legitimate struggle of the peoples in colonial bondage to regain their freedom and their liberty. That Zimbabwe, whose right to independence was so long denied and contested, is today a nation sovereign and independent is due in no small measure to the impetus generated by that Declaration.
7.	I also most warmly congratulate the new State of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on its attainment of independence and membership of the United Nations. It is our desire to forge closer relations with it as a fellow member of the Commonwealth, and to co-operate with it in building a better, safer and more just world.
8.	Universality of membership was part of the dream of the founding fathers of the United Nations for this world body. That dream is now virtually a reality. But that fact should not lure us into complacency. Rather, it should spur us into redoubling our efforts until the right to self- determination of all peoples everywhere in the world is no longer an issue. 
9.	It is with a deep sense of history that I stand before the Assembly today. Twenty years ago the late Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, the first Prime Minister of Nigeria, addressed this body on the occasion of the admission of Nigeria to membership of this world Organization.  Twenty years in the life of a nation may not represent more than a short step in the long march of history, yet for my country, which, like most third world countries, has not been spared the turmoil, turbulence and tribulations of nation building, 20 years have left indelible impressions on our national psyche. During those 20 years, two other heads of State of Nigeria also came to affirm my country's robust commitment to the high purposes and ideals of the United Nations. Today, as the first democratically elected President of my country after more than a decade of military rule, I have come solemnly to reaffirm Nigeria's enduring faith in the aims and principles of the United Nations. I therefore bring to the Assembly, in a very special and authoritative way, the greetings and good wishes of the Government and people of Nigeria.
10.	As inter-State relations grow more complex, as under-standing and mutual respect among nations and peoples become more difficult to sustain, as prospects for world peace appear more fragile, people everywhere are increasingly looking to the United Nations for answers. People everywhere want to strengthen the capacity and capability of the Organization to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. They crave to return the United Nations to its central role of being an effective instrument for harmonizing different views, reconciling competing interests and initiating such collective action as would give sustenance to man and his aspirations for peace and plenty in justice and liberty.
11.	Half a millennium of colonial rule by European Powers did not succeed in destroying our self-image as Africans. Nor did it quench our thirst to be free, to be respected and to develop our resources for the good of our people. In the past 20 years over 40 African countries have regained their freedom and independence. During that period some of them have fought civil wars not out of irreconcilable differences of ideology or ethnicity; they have fought in order to defend the gains of their independence, to frustrate foreign intervention in their affairs and to maximize their sovereign attributes. Some African States, quite tragically, have fought one another across borders. They have fought not to colonize anyone but in order to defend their perceived patrimony, to safeguard their territorial integrity. Others have fought in order to be independent. Through all the tensions and conflicts of the past 20 years, no independent African country has lost its independence. More are yearning to be free, and they soon will be free and independent. Namibia and South Africa are already waiting in the wings. They decidedly will soon be free. The message is clear: never again will Africa be colonized; never again will Africans tolerate living under racist domination and exploitation.
12.	Only last week the current Chairman of the Assembly of the OAU, my dear brother Mr. Siaka Stevens, President of Sierra Leone, addressed the Assembly on the economic and political concerns of Africa 18th meeting]. I wish to take this opportunity to pay him a tribute for his untiring efforts on behalf of our continent. His statement adequately reflected the new emphasis which Africa is placing on its economic development after decades when our overriding preoccupation was to secure the independence of our territories and peoples.
13.	Last April I had the honour of welcoming my brother African heads of State and Government to the first extraordinary meeting of the OAU devoted exclusively to consideration of the economic problems of our continent. Determined to attain the goals of economic salvation, we adopted the Lagos Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Monrovia Strategy for the Economic Development of Africa.  We were realistic to acknowledge in that historic document that, just as the liberation struggle was fought and won by us, so also would be our struggle for economic emancipation. But in our interdependent world, all nations are like a team of mountain climbers. We need one another. We must help one another. We therefore welcome constructive co-operation and partnership from the rest of the international community as we embark on the challenging task of addressing the problems of the post-colonial era in our continent.
14.	Africa bears the scars of a long history of spoliation and deprivation, of the ravages of the slave trade and foreign aggression, of both political and economic injustices. The current crisis in the world economy is wreaking havoc in Africa. For some areas of the third world the ongoing international negotiations about trade, capital (lows and so on may mean growth through effective participation in key international markets and institutions. For most of Africa those negotiations are about survival itself. The very existence of some of our nations is being critically threatened by adverse economic forces and natural disasters.
15.	It will take years before we in Africa can exercise our right to full equality and effective participation in the current international economic system. In spite of the enormous natural wealth and resources of Africa, our continent remains the least developed and our people the most deprived. These degrading disabilities make a mockery of our political independence. We are therefore resolved to make progress. We must therefore refuse to subsidize the economies of the rich by continuing to sell our raw materials and labour to them cheaply in return for their exorbitantly priced manufactured goods.
16.	I believe that the time has come for the international community to address itself to the serious issue of reparation and restitution for Africa. It is pertinent to observe that there is hardly any country outside the continent which has not in one way or another benefited from the exploitation of the human and natural resources of Africa. In the wake of the Assembly's important deliberations concerning the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade and the global negotiations, I call upon the Assembly to launch a decade of reparation and restitution for Africa as a master plan for the economic recovery of Africa. I make this call with a serious sense of responsibility. Restructuring the world economic system to conform with the dictates of the new international economic order will help, but that will be in the long-term. Massive, special, immediate and effective measures are required to deal with the exceptional situation in Africa. I have seen too much of Africa's misery and degradation not to be moved to action and to demand the proclamation of a special decade for the economic regeneration of Africa.
17.	The problems of no other continent define the international agenda better than those of Africa. I intend therefore to dwell further on African concerns, for the destiny of Nigeria is inextricably linked with the fortunes of all the countries of Africa and all the peoples of African descent abroad. As a result we have continued and shall continue to strive vigorously for the restoration of the rights and dignity of the black man everywhere, who for too long has suffered humiliation and discrimination.
18.	The situation in Namibia continues to be a source of considerable embarrassment and concern to the Organization. It continues to undermine the will and credibility of the United Nations. Above all it continues to raise serious questions about the sense of honour and good faith of some permanent members of the Security Council, grave questions about their perception of their duty and responsibilities under the Charter; for the power of the veto was not intended to be used solely for the protection of selfish interests. Rather, the veto was meant to be employed to promote and advance the high purposes of the Charter, to sustain and encourage the practice of international law and morality.
19.	Nigeria will no longer tolerate the provocations by South Africa or the dilatory tactics of its allies in the Western bloc with regard to self-determination and majority rule for Namibia. We deeply deplore the collusion between South Africa and its Western allies as a result of which the people of that Territory are denied their inalienable rights. Fourteen years have passed since the International Court of Justice handed down the judgement of 18 July 19661 that South Africa had neither the legal nor the moral right to maintain its perverse administration in Namibia. Furthermore, it is now over two years since the Security Council, in its resolution 435 (1978), endorsed the proposals by the five Western Powers for Namibia's transition to independence. I therefore find it intolerable that the independence of Namibia should continue to be devilled by the intransigence of South Africa.
20.	It seems to me that the recent exchange of correspondence between the Secretary-General and the South African Government calls for immediate action. It offers another opportunity, if any were really necessary, for the United Nations to test the true intentions of the South African Government. The United Nations Transition Assistance Group should therefore be deployed without undue delay to carry out its mandate to supervise a free and fair election in Namibia, so that by the next session of the General Assembly Namibia will have taken its rightful place in the world community of nations.
21.	Throughout all the 33 years that the apartheid policies of the Government of South Africa have been considered and condemned by the Assembly, it has become clear that the only peaceful avenue left for their elimination is the imposition of sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter. In calling again for sanctions, particularly an oil embargo to complement the existing arms embargo against South Africa, I want to emphasize that our Charter specifically prescribes sanctions to give effect to the decisions of the Security Council. I sincerely hope that the International Conference on Sanctions against South Africa, which the United Nations, in co-operation with the OAU, plans to hold next year at Paris, will succeed in addressing that important matter as an effective alternative to the use of force by the United Nations to bring about the birth of a new society in South Africa.
22.	But sanctions alone will not destroy apartheid and racism in South Africa. They can, however, be used to support the armed struggle. That struggle is now gathering momentum. If South Africa persists in its defiance of the international will for fundamental change in its policies, none of us has the right to deny the struggle of the South African nationalists full support—certainly not Nigeria. We shall continue to assist, encourage and support that struggle with all the might and all the resources at our disposal. The people of South Africa will never flinch from that struggle until ultimate victory is won. The termination of apartheid and racism in South Africa is the challenge of our decade and the attainment of that goal will constitute man's last major victory over the evil forces of colonialism.
23.	Global interdependence has too often lately been defined in narrow economic terms. Given its full dimensions of peace and security, it truly permeates and dominates every aspect of international life today. In no area is that concept more ominously felt than the Middle East, a region which lies so close to Africa and has such supreme symbolism for my country.
24.	The Middle East situation is of the gravest concern to Nigeria. At the international level, we have spared no effort in the councils of the OAU, the United Nations or the non-aligned countries to seek a viable solution in conformity with the highest imperatives of peace and justice. We do not believe that peace and justice are incompatible.
25.	If all the States in the region are to enjoy the right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force, the inalienable rights of the Palestinians cannot and must not be overlooked. To an African, the rights of self-determination, statehood and independence are sacred. To a continent which can easily fall prey to military might, the occupation of territory by force is totally unacceptable. To a people who believe in the United Nations, scornful disrespect for the decisions of the Security Council cannot be justified.
26.	In my view, Israel's persistent refusal to recognize the fact that it cannot continue to enjoy legitimacy and rights based on the Organization's original Partition Plan for Palestine [resolution 181 (II)] and at the same time deny to the Palestinians the corresponding legitimacy and rights of nationhood based on the same Plan is the greatest obstacle to any lasting peace in the Middle East. The Palestinian Arabs must and should be enabled to have their own independent sovereign State. Nigeria firmly supports the legitimate right of the Palestinians to their homeland. Israel cannot expect normalization of relations with Nigeria, indeed with Africa, while it continues, in defiance of world public opinion, to occupy the Arab territories which it captured in 1967. Furthermore, its unilateral expropriation of Arab lands and implantation of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories makes any meaningful discussion of normalization of relations at this time even more difficult. Its recent action purporting to alter the present international status of Jerusalem came as an affront to the conscience of my people, to whom Jerusalem has a special meaning and significance. We therefore cannot and will never accept these measures.
27.	In the face of the numerous challenges confronting mankind, it would be superfluous to say how much my Government deeply regrets the current tragic conflict between the non-aligned States of Iran and Iraq. I fervently add my voice to the many appeals for restraint and peace between those two neighbouring countries.
28.	Recent events give us no cause for joy. The tensions and crises which developed last year remain virtually unresolved. The armaments race has assumed a new and dangerous momentum, at a time when the second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons has failed. The North- South dialogue on the economic problems of the world is stalemated, as a consequence of a most regrettable inability to agree even on procedures to begin negotiations. The present stalemate in the climate of negotiations between the developing and the developed countries holds terrifying prospects for all. Perhaps, more than is realized, the world is poised delicately on the brink—that critical margin— between survival and disaster.
29.	The dangers may be grave, but we cannot afford to despair. Our needs and times call for statesmanship imbued with courage and vision: vision to determine where to begin and courage to do what has to be done. The present uncertain international situation challenges all those entrusted with the responsibility of safeguarding the destiny of mankind to pause and think. Times have changed. Conditions have changed. The concepts and structures which precipitated some of the current international crises cannot remain unchanged. Any organic institution without the means to adjust to change is without the means for its survival.
30.	We have the men and the means to meet the challenge of the 1980s and beyond. The sum of over $500 billion, which the developed countries have spent on military research and development since 1960, far exceeds what two thirds of mankind require to banish poverty and degradation. There must be disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, to save mankind from untoward anxiety and the holocaust. There must be disarmament to release resources for development. The justification for the retention of nuclear weapons has always, to my mind, been a negative one. Weapons susceptible of causing accidental warfare and capable of destroying all mankind can never act as deterrents to war.
31.	The member States of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC], in spite of the unwarranted calumnies often heaped on them, have amply demonstrated what developing countries can do to help themselves and other less fortunate developing countries. They have shown how raw material-producing, developing countries can organize themselves to defend their economic rights. They have shown how to arrest the historical trend whereby the rich countries get increasingly richer at the expense of the poor countries. It is therefore a matter of regret that quite deliberate efforts are sometimes made to mislead the public about the role of energy in the prevailing economic crisis. OPEC prices have risen only in direct proportion to the inflation and price rises generated by the prohibitive costs of imported goods and services as well as the fluctuating rate of exchange of the dollar.
32.	The rich, industrialized countries must show a disposition to accept the fact that the present international economic system, based on imperial patterns of thought and relationships, which deny equal opportunity to all mankind, can no longer endure. They must accept the fact that there can be no meaningful and lasting progress on the issues that are of direct and proximate interest to them unless they are prepared to entertain overdue reforms on issues such as money and finance, resource flow, industrialization, trade and protectionism which are so germane to the realization of the aspirations of the developing countries.
33.	The rich industrialized countries must shoulder their responsibility to the poor nations of the world, from which they have gained so much in wealth and resources. They must address themselves to the burning issue of how to assist them in an imaginative and compassionate spirit, particularly the least developed countries, which are today overburdened with poverty and unfulfilled aspirations.
34.	Mr. President, I began with messages of congratulations to you and congratulations on your outstanding achievements on the international scene. I should like to conclude on a note of hope. As I look back, I am encouraged by what can be achieved if Member States, faithful to the ideals and principles of the Charter, agree to work for solutions to the myriad problems of our time.
35.	We have come some way but have a long way to go. We have made some progress but the end of the journey is still far. But reach it we must. Since the beginning of human history the world has been full of conflicts, disputes and wars. This is the tragedy of human existence. The big question is can man ever live with his neighbour in perfect harmony? Can areas of conflict be reduced? In short: can wars be avoided? Some may answer yes; others may say no. Whatever our answer may be, one thing cannot be disputed: that we stand to gain in a world of peace and to lose in a world of war. We must therefore commit ourselves to ensuring peace in the world.
36.	Our greatest hope for realizing peace is the United Nations. Each day the problems of the world multiply in number and in complexity. If the United Nations is to keep abreast of them, and if it is to reflect the vast increase in the number and strength of its membership, then it has to undergo some form of organizational change.
37.	I do not refer only to its method of work and operation being changed to ensure greater efficiency. Some institutional or structural reform should be considered to democratize its decision-making process. In particular we call attention to the proposal for the expansion of the membership of the Security Council, which Nigeria strongly supports.
38.	Each and every one of us must be ready to take his turn and to play his part in the worthwhile endeavour of ensuring the survival of justice and peace. As I have observed, peace cannot be achieved by mere resolutions or declarations. It can only be achieved through commitment. Delaying tactics will not help. We are not asking any nation to abandon its national interests. We are asking all nations to be reasonable in the pursuit of those interests.
39.	The world is perched on the threshold of a new and significant decade, a decade of renewal as well as change, a decade of challenge as well as hope, a decade of opportunity as well as danger. What precisely it will be depends on what we make it. With the required good will, we can make it a decade of positive achievement for mankind.




1981

First of all, on behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf, I wish to extend to Mr.
Kittani our warmest congratulations on his election and assumption of the office of President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. His election is undoubtedly a testimony to his outstanding personal qualities, as well as a justly deserved reward for his long, selfless and outstanding contribution to the United Nations, which he has served in various capacities with such distinction for more than two decades. I am fully confident that, under his able and wise guidance, our proceedings at this session will be quite successful. I can assure him, particularly in view of the amity that exists between our two countries, that he can count on my delegation for the fullest possible cooperation in the discharge of his onerous duties and responsibilities.
274.	1 should like also to take this opportunity to pay the warmest tribute to the President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly, Mr. von Wechmar of the Federal Republic of Germany, for the able manner in which he guided the proceedings in the past year, when the Assembly was faced with many major issues of war and peace. It is to his credit that during his tenure of office he displayed great personal qualities, a sense of fair play and a complete dedication to the cause of peace in serving the Assembly as President.
275.	I should like also to take this opportunity to extend my warmest congratulations to Vanuatu and also to Belize on their accession to independence and on their admission as the one hundred fifty-fifth and one hundred fifty-sixth Members of the Assembly and the comity of nations. With their admission, we are now nearer our dream of attaining the universality of the United Nations.
276.	I believe that we also owe our SecretaryGeneral much gratitude for his dedication to duty and his unfailing concern for the welfare and good health of the Organization. At no time have these sterling qualities served the United Nations better than in the past few years, when the international system has suffered considerable strains and tensions.
277.	It is with great concern that my country and delegation view the general deterioration in the international situation since last year. On many of the prevailing global issues, we are no nearer to a solution. In several cases the prospects for resolving the problems are actually dimmer. Our willingness and capacity for the resolution of the major problems which now plague the world seem to have diminished considerably, despite the fact that here in the Assembly and within the United Nations system we have all devoted considerable time and energy to our common search for a durable solution to the strains and tensions in the international situation. Yet the need for a peaceful resolution of these problems has never been greater or more urgent, in view of the great danger to international peace and security engendered by these international tensions and strains.
278.	My delegation is particularly concerned about the situation now developing in southern Africa, an issue over which a special session of the Assembly met only two weeks ago. There are three major elements in the situation now evolving in southern Africa, each one of which has the potential for erupting into a major world conflict. First, there is the continued occupation of Namibia by the racist regime of South Africa despite repeated pronouncements by the Assembly and the International Court of
Justice that such occupation is illegal. There is no need to rehash the several General Assembly resolutions demanding the withdrawal of the racist regime of South Africa from Namibia, nor is it necessary for me to bore the Assembly with details of the efforts that have been made, without any success, to secure the withdrawal of the racist South African regime from that Territory. All this is too well known to require any further elaboration. The SecretaryGeneral has in his annual report also alluded to all the major efforts made by the Organization to secure a peaceful settlement in Namibia, including the United Nations peace plan on Namibia, which the Security Council approved in resolution 435 (1978) and which was unanimously endorsed by the Assembly [resolution ES8/2]. All these activities eventually produced the Geneva meeting at which the racist regime of South Africa behaved in a most irresponsible manner by slamming the door on a negotiated settlement.
279.	It is, therefore, a matter for deep regret that the danger posed to international peace and security by the continuing illegal occupation of Namibia by the racist regime of South Africa is not recognized by some Powers which willfully, and in an arrogant display of power, now openly encourage the racist and illegal regime of South Africa to continue its open defiance of the Organization. We have in recent weeks witnessed the bizarre spectacle of racist South Africa's forces launching a vicious, unprovoked and barbaric attack on the sovereign State of Angola under the pretext of pursuing SWAPO freedom fighters in that country.
280.	No other subject has provided such absurd theatricals this year as has the subject of Namibia's independence; but we are far from amused. We have witnessed otherwise civilized nations cannibalize some of the most sacrosanct tenets of democracy in a desperate effort to make southern Africa safe for exploitation by the West, by the denial of freedom to the people of Namibia. We have witnessed nations that in February 1981 condemned South Africa for its duplicity and disruptive tactics during the Geneva pre-implementation talks veto sanctions resolutions against South Africa two months later in the Security Council in order to save the apartheid regime from economic, cultural and political ostracism. We have seen a leading advocate of a peaceful solution of the problems of Namibia's independence recently veto a Security Council resolution condemning South Africa's criminal invasion of Angola in violation of that nation's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Indeed, only a few weeks ago, at the eighth emergency special session of the General Assembly, we were witnesses to the callous indifference of a cluster of Western nations which abstained on a consensus resolution that could have enhanced and accelerated Namibia's independence.
281.	However, these are merely symptoms of the times, an index of the convoluted rationalization of evil by a new breed of leaders of men and nations that has made it possible for otherwise rational beings in so-called civilized nations to agree to coexist with apartheid South Africa, that has enabled the exponents of democratic principles on earth to stifle the buds of freedom in Namibia and that has permitted and rationalized the use of naked aggression against Angola by South Africa, ostensibly as part of the white man's self-imposed burden to expurgate communism from southern Africa. For our part, we reject these tendentious premises, which provide no more than a smokescreen for what is essentially an amoral and materialistic, as well as a racially biased, policy.
282.	We have no illusions about the magnitude of the problems facing us at this session of the General Assembly on the question of Namibia's independence. At the same time, we have no doubts about the consequences of failing to take appropriate measures to meet the challenge which continued South African intransigence poses. At the very least, we feel it necessary to reiterate some eternal principles associated with the Namibian struggle, lest our civility be mistaken for cowardice and our inaction taken for acquiescence.
283.	Of the many things with which the world's historical landscape is strewn, the wreck of an abandoned liberation struggle is not one of them. And it is certain that, as night follows day, the struggle for the genuine independence of Namibia, under a democratically elected Government led by SWAPO, will never be abandoned. In plain language, it means that the day will never come when African nations will despair of the struggle for Namibia's independence and cast it adrift as a hostage to South Africa. That would be a gesture of abject surrender and appeasement to which no true African, with the blood of his proud ancestors running through his veins, will ever subscribe. If any proof of this were needed, the recent emergency summit meeting of die front-line States and Nigeria in Lagos should provide ample testimony of the continuing pursuit of the goal of that country's independence. The achievement of that goal remains a cardinal objective of the foreign policy of my country, and we will not relent until victory is won. Indeed, on the issue of Namibia's independence, all African countries are front-line States, and our continental commitment to the achievement of that goal will never waver or falter, come what may, no matter what the price. In this connection, we reiterate our unflinching support for SWAPO and our commitment to the early implementation of the Namibia plan approved by the Security Council in resolution 435 (1978) without amendment, modification or amplification.
284.	In recent months, the element of superPower ideological rivalry has been introduced into the already muddy political waters of southern Africa, with a view to confusing the direct and simple issue of the independence of the oppressed in that area. The underlying aim, no doubt, is to provide a pretext for the entrenchment of neocolonialism in that part of our continent through its Achilles' heel. We know that the most strenuous efforts are being made to forge a link between the withdrawal of foreign troops from Angola and progress towards Namibia's independence. We see none, and unreservedly repudiate the claims of extra-continental Powers to dictate to any African country who their friends shall be when their national survival is threatened.
285.	As long as South Africa continues its criminal military rampage over the territorial boundaries of sovereign African States, as long as that criminal State continues with its efforts to destabilize Angola, Mozambique and other neighboring States with the active encouragement and support of some Western Powers, so long will Angola and, indeed, every African State which is threatened feel obliged to obtain military assistance from any quarter in order to preserve its sovereignty. The termination of South Africa's presence in Namibia and of its acts of aggression against neighboring African States is an indispensable precondition for the withdrawal of foreign military presence from the affected parts of the region.
286.	Only very recently, the Foreign Minister of that pariah State was alleged to have called for cooperation between his country and Nigeria in the interests of the security, peace and progress of Africa. The racist regime need only pull out its aggressive troops from Angola and other front-line States, cooperate fully with the international community to achieve independence for Namibia and replace the obnoxious apartheid system within its borders with genuine democratic majority rule based on universal adult suffrage. It will then find Nigeria and, indeed, all African States ever willing and ready to extend the right hand of fellowship and to welcome it wholeheartedly into the fold of the OAU.
287.	The multiple crises which have continued to bedevil international .relations reveal one of their worst features in the economic sphere. That the world economy has suffered an alarming deterioration since the Assembly met this time last year is a fact well known to everyone. One has even heard it said by authoritative analysts that mankind may in fact be witnessing now the worst economic recession since the Great Depression. Of course, that is the painful fact of the situation as the prospects for sustained growth and development are seriously constrained by persistent high levels of global inflation, acute payments imbalances, instability of commodity markets, growing protectionism, declining volume of official development assistance, deteriorating terms of trade and unstable exchange rates fueled by an archaic international monetary system.
288.	The cumulative effect of these phenomena has been a drastic slowdown in economic growth for all. countries, particularly the developing countries, most of which have in fact registered negative growth over the last couple of years. One does not have to go far in the search for an explanation for this sorry state of affairs, because the incontestable fact is that our economies have been most particularly vulnerable to the factors enumerated above, which for the most part are of external origin and underscore the question of the structural maladjustment of the international economic system.
289.	We in the developing countries cannot but feel gravely concerned about the extreme severity of the impact of the current global economic crisis on us. The food situation has been particularly critical as many developing countries have resorted to massive food importation, which in turn has aggravated their foreign exchange position with adverse effects on their development process. So also has the very high cost of manufactured and capital goods slowed down the process of industrialization in developing countries, thereby curtailing opportunities for the diversification of their economies so crucial to the attainment of self-reliant development.
290.	To this must be added the consequences of the prevailing instability in the export markets for primary commodities, which has resulted in the steady decline in our export earnings and, indeed, the purchasing power of the unit cost of primary exports. A? contemporary events show, even crude oil has not escaped the fate which raw materials have Additionally been subjected to, as those with their hands on the levers of economic power, namely, the developed market economies, have once more been at the game which they are well equipped to play, thanks to the existing inequitable structure of the international economy.
291.	Thus, by the most surreptitious strategic maneuvers, as it has done and is still doing with other raw materials, the industrialized North has managed to induce an artificial glut in the world supply for crude oil. My delegation cannot but deplore any strategy which is designed to strangle oil-producing developing countries with the sinister purpose of making energy a non-issue at any resumed global negotiations. We are convinced that the prevailing adverse trends in the world economy must not be allowed to continue, as this can only spell doom for all of us.
292.	Urgent solutions are therefore called for. There must be a steady flow of additional financial resources to developing countries, which also need increasing access to technology, in respect of which the developed countries still enjoy a monopoly. These and other requirements are well-accepted prerequisites for the accelerated development of developing countries. Of course, they are clearly underlined in the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade, the faithful implementation of which we see as a historic responsibility from which the international community, especially the developed countries, cannot afford to shy away.
293.	The moment has been reached when something has to be done about the flagging spirit of multilateral economic cooperation. The hope of peace and plenty which is held forth by our great Organization must not be denied to the vast mass of humanity simply because of the present financial constraints faced by every nation. For many, particularly in the developing countries, the role of the United Nations development system in resource transfer can hardly be underestimated. It is, therefore, important that Member States, particularly the developed countries, should continue to give their full support to the system.
294.	It would be unrealistic, of course, not to acknowledge some encouraging developments which have occurred in the last few months. Happily, the developing countries themselves, which have been hardest hit by the prevailing economic crisis, have not stood still with arms folded. On the contrary, believing in the practical wisdom and the rewards of self-help, representatives of those countries gathered in Caracas in May of this year for the High Level Conference on Economic Cooperation among Developing Countries. The Program of Action which was adopted on that occasion [see A/36/333] has since become an invaluable instrument for enhancing the collective self-reliance of developing countries, while it also represents their contribution to international economic cooperation for development. We earnestly hope that this noble endeavor of the developing countries will continue to receive the maximum support of the international community, and in particular the United Nations system.
295.	Right now attention is being turned to another important international meeting which will take place next month, the International Meeting on Cooperation and Development to be held at Cancun. It is true that this meeting will be held outside the United Nations system, but the potential contribution which it can make to strengthening international economic cooperation will hardly be denied. In any case, my Government hopes that the impending summit meeting will be guided in its deliberations by the sobering realization that a common destiny unites us all and that the objective of the meeting, to provide the needed impetus for the global negotiations, will be achieved.
296.	The international community has waited too long for the global negotiations to get under way. A further delay could be ominous because, as earlier underlined, the world economic crisis is deepening with each passing day. There must be a return to the commitment solemnly made when the Assembly adopted resolution 34/138.
297.	Increasingly, our world is ruled by contradictions and ironies, and nowhere is that more true than in the issue of man's survival. Every year there are ritualistic exhortations in this forum calling for global disarmament. Instead, we are made helpless spectators of accelerated deadly rearmament on a global scale in a sort of geometrical progression. Conversely, the security supposedly guaranteed by this upsurge in armaments buildup proves more elusive in direct proportion to the increase in the armaments stockpile. It is a vicious circle which would be laughable if its consequences were not so deadly serious.
298.	However, we must point not only to the* great danger of stockpiling those lethal weapons but also to the growing aggressiveness of nations and the ominous new phenomenon of a ready, even eager, disposition to engage in the so-called tactical nuclear warfare. Nuclear warfare was always thought of and regarded as a last resort in the worst type of scenario, unlikely ever to happen because of the existing balance of terror, and the assured destruction capacity of a retaliatory second strike. Now, the new generation of tactical nuclear missiles, with their fiendish capacity for alleged 'contained' warfare, makes the early deployment of nuclear weaponry in the event of war a much desired strategy.
299.	We need not, and will not, bow in despair before the awesome might of the nuclear Powers. Rather, we must oblige them to accept and recognize the fact that part of the attributes of sovereignty which every State enjoys is the prerogative to determine the manner in which its citizens can live or die and that any abridgment of that right constitutes a violation of the most fundamental of all human rights the right to live. When some countries decide to embark on a reckless arms buildup, it becomes the legitimate right of other States to express their concern and apprehension. That is why we feel compelled and justified to call upon those who have so obstinately sought to intimidate the rest of mankind with the greatest arms buildup the world has ever known to recognize that the earth is ours too, and that we are unwilling to permit its wanton and mindless destruction. We believe that enough is enough. The United Nations must redouble its effort to bring some sanity to the arms race, but such effort will succeed only to the extent that nations, individually and collectively, decide to turn their swords into ploughshares and release for peaceful development the vast resources at present devoted to missiles.
300.	Nigeria welcomes the decision to hold the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament in 1982, in the expectation that the opportunity will be used to reassess the disarmament postures of
States, the status of implementation of the Program of Action adopted during the first special session on disarmament in 1978 [see resolution S1012], the role of the pertinent United Nations organs and the importance of public opinion in disarmament efforts.
301.	May I now draw attention to some of the other flash-points of our troubled world. It is the earnest hope of my country that during this session progress will be made in the relaxation of tensions in the Middle East, through involving the long-suffering Palestinians in a peace process that will ultimately secure for them a homeland of their own, as well as assuring security to the State of Israel. We also hope that this session will see the end of the fratricidal war between Iraq and Iran, two friendly nonaligned nations that need to divert their attention to improving the lot of their people. It is also to be hoped that genuine progress will be achieved in the settlement of the Afghanistan and Kampuchean issues, through the withdrawal of all foreign forces and allowing the peoples of those countries to sort out their international problems peacefully with the help of the United Nations.
302.	The Organization faces today the greatest ever challenge throughout the history of its existence. Whether it be in the political, economic or armament field, our world is on the brink of colossal disaster. A few nations have acquired the capacity to save the world from, or plunge it into, Armageddon. Let us hope that the leaders of those nations will rise above petty, narrow, selfish interests. Let us hope that they will refrain from being the victims of the arrogance of power. Let us hope that the peace, welfare and betterment of the human race as a whole will be their prime concern as it is the concern of all of us as Members of the world Organization. Let us hope that together we will be true and faithful to our great Charter in the interest of peace, prosperity and progress of the whole of mankind.
303.	




1982

On behalf of the people and Government of the 
Federal Republic of Nigeria, I extend to Mr. 
Hollai our warmest congratulations on his 
election to and assumption of the office of 
President of the thirty-seventh session of the 
General Assembly. His election is eloquent 
testimony to his admirable personal qualities as 
well as an honour to the Hungarian People's 
Republic, with which, happily, my country, 
Nigeria, enjoys very cordial relations. I am 
quite confident that under his able and wise 
guidance, our deliberations at this session will 
be resoundingly successful. I assure him of the 
full co-operation of my delegation in the 
discharge of the heavy responsibilities of his 
office. May I also pay a tribute to his 
predecessor in office, Mr. Kittani of Iraq, who 
presided over the thirty-sixth session of the 
General Assembly with great dedication and 
distinction. The able manner in which he guided 
the proceedings of the thirty-sixth session when 
grave issues of war and peace were at stake is a 
credit to him and to his country, Iraq. I also 
wish to congratulate Mr. Perez de Cuellar on his 
well-deserved election to the exalted post of 
Secretary-General. His election is thoroughly 
deserved. It is not only a personal achievement 
for him and for his country, but one in which we 
of the third world can collectively take 
justifiable pride. In the short time he has been 
in office, Mr. Perez de Cuellar has already shown 
great courage and a strong commitment to the 
principles of the Charter of the United Nations. 
We are indeed fortunate to have the services of 
such a distinguished and accomplished 
international statesman. He has assumed office at 
a most difficult period in the life of the United 
Nations, when confrontation has replaced detente 
in relations between the super-Powers, when the 
world economy is sinking into depression and when 
naked aggression rather than peaceful coexistence 
and respect for sovereignty has become the order 
of the day in international relations. I pledge 
to him the full support of my delegation in the 
execution of the onerous task placed on his 
shoulders.
The rapid and seemingly inexorable deterioration 
in international relations is of great concern to 
my delegation. Many of the global issues that 
have plagued the Organization for many years have 
persisted in the unwholesome atmosphere of 
confrontation and repeated aggression. There is 
no doubt that the great majority of nations are 
dedicated to peace. Nevertheless, one is left 
with the sad feeling that all our efforts are an 
exercise in futility since none of the major 
issues of our time appears to have been resolved. 
The litany of political and economic crises which 
now plague the world is formidable and spans 
every region of the world.
Detente between the super-Powers has suffered a 
severe setback. There has been a resurgence of 
cold war attitudesóa situation which has been 
further aggravated by the virtual state of 
collapse of the international economic system. 
The spirit of internationalism and the 
interdependence of nations of the world have been 
gravely impaired. Nations, particularly the big 
Powers, are now resorting increasingly to the use 
or threat of use of force in defense of what they 
perceive to be their national interests. The 
provisions of the Charter on the settlement of 
international disputes and on the maintenance of 
international peace and security are being 
brushed aside and ignored by the big Powers in 
pursuit of their narrow interests.
In this present climate of uncertainty, the 
Secretary-General, in his report on the work of 
the Organization, called Car measures to 
strengthen the peace-keeping machinery of the 
United Nations system and to develop the United 
Nations as a more effective and viable instrument 
for resolving disputes among States. He has 
called our attention to the propensity of the big 
Powers to bypass the United Nations whenever it 
suits them and to the necessity to return to the 
United Nations as the primary international 
negotiating forum. His warnings are timely and 
should be heeded by all Member States.
We are gravely concerned in particular about the 
areas of tension which continue to exist in 
Africa. We attach the utmost importance to peace 
and stability in Africa, without which our 
efforts to develop our countries will continue to 
be frustrated. We are concerned about the 
continued intervention in African affairs of the 
big Powers and their attempt to turn Africa into 
a cold-war theatre. Africa's efforts to solve its 
problems in Western Sahara and the Horn of Africa 
continue to be undermined by the intervention of 
the big Powers. We deplore and view with 
resentment these unwarranted interventions in our 
internal affairs and the consequent 
intensification of intra-African disputes. 
Whenever it has seemed we are close to a peaceful 
settlement of disputes among African States, the 
process of peace has been gravely weakened and 
undermined by the intervention of extra-African 
Powers. Weapons of mass destruction continue to 
find their way into our continent in the guise of 
foreign military assistance. In order to maintain 
their hegemony in Africa, the big Powers have 
resorted to so- called military assistance, which 
has increased sharply over all other forms of aid 
in recent years. In addition, there has been an 
insidious attempt by external forces to weaken 
and destroy our continental organization, the 
OAU, which they regard as inimical to their 
dominant influence in our continent. The fact is 
the OAU, now facing a serious assault by our 
detractors, has contributed immensely to the 
maintenance of peace and stability in the region. 
By bringing Africa together and forging bonds of 
unity within the continent, the OAU has 
contributed to the fulfilment of provisions of 
the Charter of the United Nations on the role of 
regional organizations in resolving regional 
disputes.
Let me assure our detractors now plotting daily 
the demise of our organization that we will 
emerge from our present crisis stronger than 
ever. In the past our continental organization 
has demonstrated its resilience and capacity by 
withstanding several serious internal crises. 
Africa remains committed to the maintenance and 
continued stability of its continental 
organization, and collectively we are determined 
to repair the damage and the setback which it has 
recently suffered.
My delegation is extremely disturbed and 
distressed by the stalemate in the negotiations 
on the independence of Namibia. I believe that we 
have shown the utmost restraint and understanding 
in the negotiations with the contact group. It is 
not necessary to go over the ground covered in 
those negotiations. However, it is necessary to 
remind the Assembly that apartheid, South 
Africa's Mandate over Namibia, has been 
terminated by the United Nations and the 
international Court of Justice. South Africa's 
continued occupation of Namibia is illegal and in 
defiance of the unanimous decision of the 
Assembly, which gives protection to all nations.
The greatest threat to the survival of the United 
Nations is the absolute disregard of its 
decisions by a few recalcitrant nations. The 
saddest aspect of the tragedy being played out in 
the southern African region is that the apartheid 
regime draws comfort, solace and support from the 
same countries as arrogate to themselves the role 
of defender of democratic freedoms. How can those 
Western countries explain to the world why, in 
spite of resolution 435 (1978), sponsored by the 
contact group, adopted by the Security Council 
and unanimously endorsed by the General Assembly, 
effective pressure cannot be brought to bear on 
South Africa to withdraw from Namibia as a 
prelude to the implementation of the United 
Nations peace plan for Namibia?
Last year the impression was created that the 
Namibia issue was very near solution. It is now 
crystal clear to all that a peaceful solution of 
the Namibian problem is as far away as ever. It 
is now obvious to us that the strategy is to wear 
us down to a point where we shall throw up our 
hands and say: 'We have tried. Let Namibia fend 
for itself.' This strategy fails to take account 
of the tide of history, of our resolve to rid our 
continent of the last lingering vestiges of 
colonialism and oppression, and of our rendezvous 
with destiny.
A tenuous effort is being made to predicate the 
independence of Namibia on the withdrawal of 
Cuban troops from Angola. This is unfortunate, 
and we reject this unwarranted and arrogant 
demand; it has nothing to do with the legitimate 
right of Namibia to self-determination. Right now 
South Africa is occupying by force a portion of 
the territory of the independent State of Angola, 
which the foreign forces are there to protect. 
But for the decision which Angola took, in the 
exercise of its sovereignty, to invite the 
foreign forces,	South Africa would have 
recolonized it. We call upon the Western Powers 
to support the principle of self-determination 
for Namibia as a demonstration of their 
sincerity. We maintain that South Africa's 
occupation of Namibia is illegal, as well as 
contemptuous of the United Nations. We believe 
that the people of Namibia, under the leadership 
of SWAPO, are entitled to their freedom and the 
pursuit of happiness. We shall persist in this 
belief and we shall continue to fight for this 
belief until our brothers in Namibia are free.
Inside South Africa the racist regime has 
intensified its reign of terror against the 
blacks of that country, who are still being 
denied their basic freedoms. Repression and 
suppression of the blacks have continued with 
unabated rigour. We have warned often enough that 
the racist policies of the apartheid regime 
represent a grave danger to peace and stability, 
not only in Africa but throughout the world; for 
peace and freedom are indivisible. The world 
cannot be truly free and peaceful when parts of 
it remain in bondage. Africa is committed to the 
eradication of racism in South Africa. Nor will 
it be deterred by the attempts of the racist 
regime to destabilize and undermine the 
independence of its neighbours. We call on the 
Assembly to redouble its efforts and bring the 
necessary pressure to bear on the apartheid 
regime by imposing economic sanctions on it. Each 
time we call for economic sanctions against South 
Africa certain Western countries demur on the 
ground that sanctions do not work. When, however, 
the vital interests of the West are at stake 
sanctions are invoked, as they have been over 
Afghanistan, Poland and the Falkland Islands.
The present parlous state of the world economy is 
a vindication of the warning that many developing 
countries have issued for many years from this 
rostrum. Today, in every country of the world, 
the term 'depression' is very well understood. At 
this time last year we were describing the 
economic phenomenon that we were experiencing as 
recession. This year we call it depression. Very 
few countries have registered any appreciable 
growth in their economic activities during the 
past year; as a matter of fact, the economies of 
most countries have been badly ravaged. The 
consequences of this decline in economic activity 
are massive unemployment, incredibly high levels 
of global inflation, high debt-servicing ratio 
for many developing countries, sharp falls in 
commodity prices, unstable exchange rates and 
protectionism in international trade. The 
slow-down in economic activity is global. The 
present state of the world economy provides ample 
proof that our economies are interdependent.
Agriculture has all but collapsed in many parts 
of Africa, due in part to drought and, of course, 
to the unreasonably low commodity prices, 
including the high cost of agricultural 
machinery. The fact is that many countries in 
Africa spend a significant portion of their 
meagre foreign exchange earnings on massive food 
importations to stave off hunger. Very few 
developing countries can afford, after paying for 
food imports, to buy capital goods for 
industries. The net result is that developed 
countries are able to market only a small 
proportion of their manufactured goods in these 
countries, and so the vicious economic circle 
persists.
The reluctance of the developed countries to 
embrace the new international economic order so 
necessary for combatting the global economic 
crisis is deeply regrettable.
We are convinced that the present negative trends 
in the world economy can be reversed. Since they 
affect all countries, action should be taken 
collectively to resolve them. It is therefore a 
matter of deep regret that the prevailing mood in 
the developed economies today is a negative one, 
as illustrated by declines in the flow of 
official development assistance, a clearly 
expressed preference for bilateralism over 
multilateralism which has seriously undermined 
the integrity of the multilateral institutions of 
the United Nations and, of course, the lack of 
encouraging progress in negotiations on various 
questions relating to international economic 
co-operation for development. These trends 
undermine the development process of developing 
countries, but events have also shown that the 
short-sighted and unilateral policies pursued by 
certain developed countries are self-defeating 
even for those countries.
Without losing sight of the need for a 
fundamental restructuring of the world economy, 
my delegation would like to join in the call 
already made for reviving the waning spirit of 
international economic co-operation in the 
interest of steady global development and in 
particular the accelerated development of 
developing countries. My delegation is of the 
view that opportunities for further enhancing 
international economic relations still exist. It 
is auspicious that two international meetings on 
trade and development are scheduled to take place 
within the next few months, namely, the GATT 
Ministerial Meeting next November and the sixth 
session of UNCTAD in mid- 1983. My delegation 
believes that these meetings can contribute 
immensely to the reactivation of international 
trade and improved trading prospects for 
developing countries, if the countries of the 
North will show a more positive attitude 
regarding the evident need to make the necessary 
structural adjustments.
Similarly, the present structure of international 
monetary and financial institutions leaves much 
to be desired and calls for urgent reforms. My 
delegation does not underestimate the 
contribution being, made by international 
financial institutions, such as the World Bank 
group, to the development of developing 
countries; but there are also many areas 
requiring a better response by these institutions 
to the special needs of developing countries. The 
very stiff conditionally of International 
Monetary Fund lending, for instance, is resented 
by developing countries. While we are not 
suggesting that the principles of sound financial 
management should be compromised, we can see no 
advantage in the application of medicine which 
leaves the patient either worse off than before 
or dead.
With the present credit squeeze unlikely to ease 
immediately, the need for expanding the capital 
base of the World Bank has become more urgent. It 
is also timely to underline the inadequacy of 
present development aid, as the performance of 
donor countries has not gone beyond one half of 
the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national 
product solemnly agreed to in the International 
Development Strategy for the Third United Nations 
Development Decade. We urge them, therefore, not 
only to step up official assistance to the poorer 
nations but also to ensure that an increasing 
proportion of that assistance flows through the 
development organizations of the United Nations 
system, which are currently experiencing critical 
resources problems.
The development problems which confront the 
international community today call for prompt and 
equitable solutions. Important initiatives need 
to be taken with a view to alleviating the 
critical food shortages in several developing 
countries, the slow pace of their 
industrialization, and the low level of 
technological attainment, for which the speedy 
conclusion of negotiations for the international 
code of conduct on the transfer of technology and 
the establishment of long-term arrangements of 
the United Nations financing system for science 
and technology for development acquire special 
significance.
A feeling of despair and despondency must be 
avoided, despite the present mood. We should not, 
in fact, overlook the bright spots in 
international cooperation which, happily, have 
resulted from certain efforts by the developing 
countries.
Last year, much was said about the epoch- making 
event of establishing a systematic framework for 
the promotion of economic co-operation among 
developing countries, through the adoption of the 
Caracas Programme of Action. My delegation is 
gratified to note that that initiative has been 
further consolidated over the past few months, 
through concrete action aimed at the mutual 
economic advancement of States members of the 
Group of 77. We believe that this process will 
contribute to the strengthening of the individual 
and collective self-reliance of developing 
countries.
All countries, developed and developing, must 
show a positive determination to grapple with the 
present economic problems in a global and 
concerted manner. In this connection my 
delegation recognizes the need for ongoing 
negotiations in various international forums to 
proceed unhindered and with the requisite good 
will and understanding, particularly by the 
industrialized countries. We hope it will be 
possible to launch global negotiations at this 
session of the General Assembly, especially as 
much precious time has been lost over peripheral 
issues, apparently to gain certain advantages, 
when what is needed is for every party to go to 
the negotiating table with an open mind. Now, my 
delegation hopes that with the flexibility and 
spirit of compromise shown by the Group of 77 
through the proposal submitted last June, our 
partners will be more forthcoming on the question 
of launching the global negotiations without 
further delay. Three years after the adoption of 
General Assembly resolution 34/138, it is surely 
time the international community took that 
long-awaited step for laying the basis for a more 
just system of international economic relations, 
capable of supporting the steady growth of the 
world economy and particularly the accelerated 
and self-reliant development of developing 
countries.
In June this year Nigeria participated in the 
deliberations of the second special session of 
the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, in 
the hope that ways and means could be found to 
halt and reverse the extremely costly and 
dangerous arms race. After five weeks of 
intensive negotiations we discovered to our utter 
disappointment that the nuclear-weapon States, in 
particular, were neither willing nor ready to 
listen to the voice of reason and sanity. We 
recall the massive demonstration last June in New 
York against the immense danger which nuclear 
weapons pose to human survival. We listened to 
representatives of innumerable non-governmental 
organizations voicing their fears that the 
current trend of the arms race might result in 
nuclear war by accident, miscalculation or even 
design. We should not be insensitive to those 
justified fears of humanity.
Yet what did we achieve after five weeks of 
debate and negotiations? We have neither halted 
the arms race nor set in motion a single 
disarmament measure. It is true that at the 
second special session devoted to disarmament the 
General Assembly launched the World Disarmament 
Campaign and increased the United Nations 
Fellowship Programme on Disarmament from 20 
annual awards to 25. Those modest achievements 
scarcely touched the heart of the matter. Year 
after year, we helplessly watch the world's 
military budget leap to higher and higher levels. 
It is now of the order of $US 650 billion 
annually. Not one nuclear Power believes that its 
nuclear and conventional stockpile of arms has 
attained the optimum level necessary to guarantee 
its security. It is obvious that the more 
sophisticated and enormous the quantum of 
armaments at the disposal of each State, the less 
secure the State possessing such arms feels. What 
purpose is there in pursuing at such colossal 
cost an unattainable mirage? The world feels more 
insecure today than at any other time in the past.
The increasing reliance of nations on force rather than on negotiations 
and the good offices of the United Nations for 
the peaceful settlement of disputes is the root 
cause of our feelings of insecurity, coupled with 
the economic disaster, which has afflicted all 
nations. While the world spends more than $US 650 
billion yearly on armaments, mass unemployment, 
hunger, disease and ignorance take a heavy toll 
on two thirds of the world's population. It is a 
great indictment of our sense of social justice 
that our fellow human beings in the third world 
should die of hunger and of disease that we could 
wipe out at minimal cost, just because our 
misplaced sense of security compels us to spend 
billions of dollars on armaments which breed more 
fear and insecurity.
If those vast sums of money currently ploughed 
into the unproductive arms race were channelled 
into the economic and social sectors, their 
multiplier effect would result in vast social and 
economic activities that would provide millions 
of jobs, demolish protectionism in trade, expand 
demand and bring back prosperity to all parts of 
the world.
Is it not grossly immoral for the nuclear Powers 
to destroy us in a war intended to expand their 
spheres of influence? Our greatest desire is for 
peace in the world, especially on the part of 
peace-loving peoples who have no expansionist 
ambitions or designs. As we are firmly convinced 
that it is impossible to limit a nuclear war or 
to win it, we affirm that the only realistic 
option is to prevent it. That is why we have 
repeatedly advocated a nuclear freeze as a first 
step towards significant nuclear disarmament. We 
are motivated by the desire to halt the dangerous 
arms race that is inexorably dragging the world 
towards self-extinction. We are inclined to 
believe that a measure of parity has been 
achieved in the destructive power of the two 
blocs and that neither side, fully aware of the 
fact that it cannot win a nuclear war, will be so 
propelled by a death-wish as to launch a nuclear 
attack. My delegation therefore calls upon the 
super-Powers to agree to a freeze, followed by a 
verifiable comprehensive test ban leading to 
talks on arms reduction. With good will and faith 
neither side will find this process detrimental 
to its national interests.
While we were busy deliberating on the great 
threat to our survival posed by the rapid buildup 
of lethal weapons, the devastating war machine of 
Israel was reducing large areas of Lebanon to 
rubble with disastrous consequences for the lives 
of innocent human beings unfortunate enough to 
reside in that region of the Middle East. The 
Israelis, in an arrogant display of power, 
callously ignored the pleas of the Organization 
for a halt to that butchery. For four long 
months, the Israelis laid waste the sovereign 
State of Lebanon in utter contempt of the 
resolutions of the Security Council calling for a 
cease-fire. In historical perspective, that 
barbaric act of Israel's is reminiscent of the 
Nazi 'final solution of the Jewish question'. The 
expansionist propensity of Israel and its 
penchant for settling disputes by force are 
inconsistent with the letter and spirit of the 
Charter of the United Nations. The horror of the 
massacre at Sabra and Shatila sends chills down 
the spine. For a people that has gone through the 
horrible crucible of a genocide to be associated, 
even in a distant way, with the pogrom of Sabra 
and Shatila is a sad irony of history.
We believe that the Israelis are entitled to 
secure borders within the State of Israel. 
However, Israel's persistent refusal to realize 
that it cannot continue to enjoy legitimacy and 
rights based on the Organization's Partition Plan 
for Palestine and, at the same time, deny 
corresponding legitimacy and rights of nationhood 
under the same plan to the Palestinians is the 
greatest obstacle to any lasting peace in the 
Middle East. The Palestinian Arabs must and 
should be enabled to have their own independent 
sovereign State. Nigeria firmly supports the 
legitimate right of the Palestinians to a 
homeland of their own.
It is a matter tor regret that the fratricidal 
and unnecessary war between Iraq and the Islamic Republic 
of Iran, two non-aligned States, still lingers on 
in spite of the efforts of the United Nations and 
the Organization of the Islamic Conference to put 
an end to it. We once again call upon our friends 
in Iran and Iraq to throw aside the weapons of 
war and strive to settle their differences by 
peaceful means. . We are also gravely concerned 
over the intensification of other local and 
regional conflicts in Latin America and Asia and 
the immense suffering imposed on the peoples of 
those regions by the conflicts. As a non-aligned 
country, Nigeria condemns all foreign 
intervention in the internal affairs of the 
States in those regions. We support fully the 
efforts of the countries of Latin America and the 
Caribbean to consolidate their national 
sovereignty and to develop their political and 
economic systems, without undue foreign 
intervention or pressure on them.
In conclusion, let us resolve to adhere to the 
provisions of the Charter by faithfully abiding 
by the decisions of all organs of the United 
Nations. Let us resolve to eschew force in the 
settlement of our disputes. Let us strive to be 
open and candid in our bilateral and multilateral 
relations, so as to create an atmosphere of trust 
in which peace will reign supreme and the 
Organization will blossom.








1983
232.	 Mr. President, I should like, first of all, to join the preceding speakers in extending to you, on behalf of the Government and people of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, my warmest congratulations on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. You have assumed the presidency of this august Assembly at a particularly difficult time when the international situation is under considerable strain, with the eruption of conflicts and tensions in virtually all regions of the world and the apparent collapse of detente between the two super-Powers. Your outstanding diplomatic skills, patience and wisdom will be severely tested in the months ahead. But we are confident that under your able leadership  guidance, the General Assembly will make substantial progress towards the attainment of an enduring global peace and security.
233.	I should also like to avail myself of this opportunity to extend to your predecessor, Mr. Imre Hollai of Hungary, our deep appreciation and gratitude for the able and effective manner in which he guided the General Assembly in its deliberations in the past year. We were deeply impressed by his exertions in promoting the cause of peace throughout the world. He proved extremely adroit in his handling of very delicate and sensitive issues. The failures of this Assembly, however, particularly in reaching agreement on several critical issues, such as the launching of the global economic negotiations, cannot be blamed on him. Collectively, we bear responsibility for those failures.
234.	I should also like, on behalf of my Government and the people of Nigeria, to welcome Saint Christopher and Nevis to membership in the United Nations and to express our conviction that it will make a positive contribution to the search for global peace and security.
235.	Since the last session of this body there has been a steady and disturbing deterioration of the international situation. It has reached such crisis proportions that there is now universal concern that the world is now tottering on the brink of war.
236.	The global eruption of crises, conflicts and tensions has been further aggravated by the massive build-up of arms, especially nuclear weapons, which now represent the gravest danger to international peace and security and to the very survival of mankind itself. Ignoring mankind's pleas and appeals for sanity, the super-Powers in particular have embarked not only upon a massive accumulation of weaponry, but also a qualitative improvement of such weapons. Negotiations on arms reduction and disarmament at the various forums have continued to founder on the rock of rivalry and deep mistrust between the two super-Powers. Instead of making a steady and progressive effort towards achieving nuclear disarmament, the two Powers are hell-bent on achieving nuclear deterrence through a further expansion of their already awesome arsenals.
237.	Doomsday may well be on our doorstep now. That is why it is absolutely essential for the two super-Powers to seek  peace through co-operation, instead of adopting confrontation as a substitute for negotiation. In a futile attempt to achieve global hegemony and world domination for themselves, they have resorted to proxy wars in all regions of the world where the clearly expressed will of the people for peace, prosperity and stability is being subverted and steadily undermined through the threat and use of force. The territorial integrity and sovereignty of States, all of which are entitled to the protection of the United Nations, are being daily undermined in Chad, Nicaragua, Lebanon, Kampuchea and Afghanistan under one pretext or another and in defence of highly questionable and dubious principles and values. The most sophisticated weapons are being rapidly deployed in what is clearly an unbridled and disconcerting arrogation of power. Direct and indirect interference by the super-Powers in the internal and external affairs of small and weak States are now in the ascendancy in every region of the world.
238.	Nigeria is deeply concerned about these trends, which are clearly detrimental to peaceful coexistence among all States. The situation calls urgently for concerted global action to ensure the security of weak and small States, as well as their freedom from external interference in their internal affairs. The relaxation of tensions has become the urgent priority of the international community, but this essential goal cannot be attained through such negative concepts as the balance of terror, spheres of influence, deterrence and alien domination. Small and weak States have as much right as the big Powers to develop along their own freely chosen paths without any external interference or pressure. Efforts should be intensified at the international level actively to promote the principles of peaceful coexistence and self- determination through the conclusion of the process of decolonization.
239.	Let me now refer particularly to the situation in southern Africa, which also continues to be a matter of utmost concern to my Government. For nearly four decades now, the racist policies of the South African white minority regime have been roundly condemned in this Hall as well as in the Security Council. Our concern is not merely that racial discrimination exists in South Africa, but that it has been institutionalized, enshrined in law and made all-pervasive. All attempts at a peaceful change through necessary reforms have failed. Frustration among the blacks has made them resort to armed struggle to eradicate the apartheid system. Unless there is a fundamental change in South Africa through recognition of the inherent right of the 20 million blacks to participate fully and equally with the whites in South Africa's political and economic processes, there is a grave danger of a catastrophic racial conflict that will have serious ramifications throughout the world.
240.	If South Africa continues to spurn all appeals for a change and fails to deal justly and effectively with its racial problem, that failure will impose heavy economic, military and political penalties on its allies in the Western countries. The response and attitude of most of the Western countries to the racial problem in South Africa is not only most disappointing, but also self-defeating. Publicly they routinely join in the world-wide condemnation of South Africa's racist doctrines, but privately they continue to pursue policies which only encourage the racist regime in its intransigence. They do not support the application of the necessary economic and political pressures on South Africa to compel it to embark on the necessary eradication of its obnoxious racist doctrines. When we call for sanctions, we are told by the Western allies of racist South Africa either that the imposition of sanctions will not work or that it is incompatible with their fundamental belief in the principle of global free trade. Yet these powerful countries are quick and eager to resort to economic sanctions in less compelling situations. There is no question but that the racist regime of 

South Africa has enjoyed the encouragement, support and approval of these Western States in its arrogant rejection of am peaceful efforts to bring about the urgently desired changes in the country. Not only have the major Western Powers failed to take action against the apartheid regime in accordance with their commitments and obligations under the Charter of the United Nations, but they have directly, openly and covertly assured the racist regime of its survival and prosperity through vastly increased economic co-operation. At the recent Second World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, held at Geneva, the duplicity of the Western Powers was once again unmasked when they failed to join the consensus in the Programme of Action adopted by the Conference against the
apartheid regime and its Israeli collaborators.
241.	The so-called policy of constructive engagement with the apartheid regime is deeply offensive and repugnant to Africa and to decent men and women throughout the world. It is nothing but a cover for the sinister motives of the United States and others for continuing their policy of support for the	regime in southern Africa, and we reject it completely since it is open encouragement to the racist regime. Contrary to the claim of the present United States Administration, it is not a balanced policy. Within the framework of this policy we have seen increased diplomatic, political, economic and military cooperation between the racist regime of South Africa and its Western allies. At the United Nations the United States has assured the racist regime of South Africa of diplomatic cover by vetoing all efforts to impose punitive measures on that regime for its repeated acts of aggression against its neighbours as well as for its refusal to withdraw from Namibia. It would not even permit a condemnation of racist South Africa for its invasion and continued occupation of Angola. How can such a policy which supports the aggressor be regarded as balanced or constructive?
242.	The recent approval by the Government of the United States of the request by seven United States corporations to provide technical and maintenance services to a nuclear power installation in racist South Africa is in violation of Security Council resolutions 418 (1977) and 473 (1980). This approval is being granted despite the well-known objections of Africa and the international community to any form of nuclear co-operation or collaboration with the racist regime of South Africa.
243.	It is particularly regrettable that this approval was granted despite the persistent refusal of apartheid South Africa to allow inspection and verification of its nuclear installation by IAEA. We hope that in view of the objections raised not only by the whole of Africa but also by the international community, the United States authorities will cancel this contract, which is clearly detrimental to the cause of peace and freedom in Africa.
244.	Recently, authoritative statements were made by Washington to the effect that peace and security in southern Africa could be restored only if the so-called security concerns of the apartheid regime were met. Let me make it abundantly clear that we are unable to accept the notion that the racist regime of South Africa has any legitimate security concerns which have to be met by African States. Equally, the proposition that the African States in the region should seek peaceful coexistence with the racist regime of South Africa is most objectionable, and we reject it completely. It is apartheid South Africa that has consistently sought to undermine the peace, security and stability of the region by its incessant and unprovoked aggression against its neighbours. Collectively and separately, African States in the region have never posed, and could not now pose, any threat to the security of racist South Africa. None of them has ever attacked South Africa. In contrast, troops from the racist regime of South Africa now occupy much of southern Angola. It is the security concerns of the front-line States and not those of the apartheid regime that should be met.
245.	The apartheid regime stands universally condemned for its persistent, unjustified and unprovoked aggression and acts of destabilization against the frontline States. Recently the racist regime closed its borders with Lesotho in order to force that country to deny political refuge to those fleeing from Pretoria's persecution. When Lesotho turned to the Western allies of the racist regime, it met with a stony silence from them. Lesotho's independence and sovereignty mean nothing to them. Yet these countries which continue to collaborate with the apartheid regime would have the world believe that they are the defenders of freedom throughout the world. Africa is not and cannot be deceived by the duplicity of these Powers.
246.	With regard to the situation in Namibia, my Government would like to express its deep appreciation and gratitude to the Secretary-General for his untiring efforts to bring about the independence of that Territory. As he discovered during his recent mission to South Africa, all outstanding constitutional issues within the framework of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) had in fact been resolved during proximity talks with the contact group last year. South Africa's insistence on the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola as a precondition for Namibia's independence is merely a red herring, a pretext for pursuing other sinister objectives in Angola. Neither Angola itself, nor the presence of Cuban forces there at the invitation of the Angolan Government can conceivably be represented as a threat to the security of South Africa, which now occupies one third of Angola's territory. Without the withdrawal of South Africa's forces from Angola, the cessation of support for the UNIT A? bandits and reasonable assurances and guarantees about Angola's security, Angola cannot reasonably be expected to terminate its security arrangements with Cuba.
247.	It is the view of my Government that nothing short of the application of economic and other sanctions will bring racist South Africa to its senses. For decades all international appeals to apartheid South Africa have fallen on deaf ears. There is no longer any valid excuse or explanation for South Africa's continued intransigence except that it hopes and, indeed, believes that those Western countries that profit from the apartheid system will continue to thwart all efforts to impose sanctions on that regime.
248.	Clearly, the situation in southern Africa, particularly the persistent refusal of the racist regime to withdraw from Namibia, now calls for the invoking of the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. Those provisions, including recourse to sanctions as a punitive measure, were intended to deal with precisely the kind of situation we now have in southern Africa. Those permanent members of the Security Council which continue to prevent the Council from discharging its full responsibility by protecting the racist regime from sanctions bear a very heavy moral and historical responsibility for their reprehensible policy. They have left the people of South Africa and Namibia with no choice other than to seek redress through armed struggle. The Government and people of Nigeria will continue to provide them with all necessary support to enable them to wage their war of liberation against the racists. We have a moral obligation to do so, for our own independence and freedom 
will remain incomplete as long as these unhappy people continue to be held in bondage.
249.	My Government is equally concerned about the increasingly dangerous interventionist policy being pursued in Africa by some external Powers in Western Sahara, in the Horn of Africa and, more recently, in Chad. Localized disputes in these areas have been aggravated by foreign intervention, thus making it increasingly difficult for our continental organization, the OAU, to exercise fully its functions and responsibilities for resolving those disputes. We strongly condemn all external Powers that have intervened in Chad. Their intervention has added to the suffering and misery of the people of Chad. We therefore join in the call for the complete withdrawal of all foreign forces from Chad. The people of Chad must be allowed to resolve their differences without any external intervention. Africa must not be turned into an arena for proxy wars waged by the superpowers.
250.	The Middle East has continued to be a major centre of conflicts and tensions because of Israel's expansionist policy and aggression. My Government strongly deplores Israel's refusal to comply with Security Council resolution 497 (1981), which, we believe, provides the basis for a resolution of the Middle East problem. Israel's attempt to annex the Syrian Golan Heights, the invasion of Lebanon and the outrage of the massacres at Sabra and Shatila are an ample demonstration of Israel's complete disregard of international opinion and of the decisions of both the Security Council and the General Assembly. Nigeria is strongly opposed to those policies and will continue to support the people of Palestine in their just and legitimate demand for a homeland of their own. It is our firm conviction that a durable settlement of the problem of the Middle East can be achieved only with the active participation of all the interested parties, particularly the people of Palestine under the leadership of the PLO. Any unilateral effort towards a settlement can only be partial and is therefore doomed to failure. The recent eruption of fighting in Lebanon is sufficient evidence of the inadequacy of the settlement plan being pursued so vigorously by certain Powers. That plan will fail because it does not take fully into account the interests of the Palestinian people and their legitimate demand for a homeland of their own. In this regard, Nigeria fully supports the conclusions of the International Conference on the Question of Palestine held recently at Geneva. We deeply regret the failure of certain Western Powers to attend that Conference.
251.	My Government is also deeply concerned about the growing collaboration between Israel and South Africa, especially in the military and nuclear fields. This collaboration is inimical to the security of the whole of Africa and represents a threat to that security which Africa cannot ignore. As long as Israel persists in this policy it cannot hope for amity in its relations with Africa.
252.	Recent developments in Central America are also a matter of concern to my Government. My Government strongly deplores direct intervention in the internal affairs of Nicaragua and other Central American States by a certain Power. Regardless of our views about the direction in which those States are moving, it is morally wrong and contrary to the provisions of the Charter for any external Power to force a change in their political and economic systems through the use or threat of force. We would urge this external Power to respect the inherent right Of Nicaragua and other Central American States to develop along their freely chosen path. We fully endorse and support the efforts of the Contadora Group to ease the tension in the region and to secure a negotiated settlement which will take full account of the right of all the people of the region to national self-determination, independence and sovereignty.
253.	With regard to the situations in Afghanistan, Kampuchea and Korea, my Government is firmly convinced that only a reaffirmation and recognition of the right of the peoples of those countries to determine their own destinies, free from foreign interference, subversion, coercion or occupation and through the process of negotiations, will lead to a durable settlement. We therefore join in the call for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from those countries so as to provide a climate conducive to a negotiated settlement. The presence of foreign troops can only continue to impede the process of securing a durable peace.
254.	In addition to the profound anxieties raised by the prevailing global instability and tension, there is an equally widespread concern about the economic crisis which has confronted the world for some time now. Indifference to this crisis is a luxury which no country, no matter how strong economically, is able to afford in these circumstances, not only because of the scale of the crisis, but also because of its devastating impact on all groups of countries. It is indeed every country that suffers when world output and international trade contract in the manner already witnessed, particularly when the world economy drifts from bad to worse because of persisting maladjustments. To put it in a nutshell, international commodity markets are in a most sorry state, and the multilateral trading system is undergoing a serious erosion, while the international monetary and financial system is anything but orderly.
255.	My Government is equally concerned about the ever-widening economic gap between the developed and developing countries. This is an important point, not just because it underscores the inherent structural imbalance in the global economy, but also because the burden of adjustment in the current crisis has fallen disproportionately on the developing countries. The grim economic picture in most of the developing countries is all too familiar: high foreign debts, continued erosion of terms of trade, an unacceptably high level of inflation—most of it exported to them—sharp increases in the cost of capital and international credit, further restrictions on lending by the commercial banks and the continued decline in the flows of official development assistance. These formidable negative trends have led to a deep recession in the economies of the developing nations, resulting in a further decline in 1982 of the per capita gross domestic product of those countries. The development process has virtually come to a halt in most developing countries, as many of us have been forced by the deteriorating external environment in particular to curtail essential imports and national development programmes.
256.	The critical economic situation in the African continent should indeed be underlined at this juncture because our countries are much worse off than those of any other region of the world. At a time of global improvement in food supply, acute shortages persist in Africa and have serious consequences in terms not only of increasing famine and hunger but also of the constraining influence on development of mounting food import bills. Owing to over-dependence on the export of one or two primary commodities, the continuing decline and uncertainty in commodity prices have taken their heaviest toll on African economies. The calamitous fall of export earnings has been compounded by a contraction of the external flow of resources. Obviously, one of the major 
prerequisites for economic recovery in Africa is to ensure a substantial flow of external finance to the region.
257.	Although the universal impact of the current economic crisis obviously calls for concerted efforts by the entire international community, regrettably the multilateral spirit is on the wane. We have in the past few years continued to witness a growing reliance by the developed countries on a bilateral rather than a multilateral approach to settling the crisis confronting the world economy, particularly the economic problems of the developing countries. But we know full well that the results have been most disappointing. It is indeed widely acknowledged that the acute resource problem currently facing such leading development organizations as, for example, UNDP is attributable principally to the stagnation in the overall flow of official development assistance and the decline in the proportion committed through multilateral channels. Aside from this we see little advantage in undue recourse to bilateralism, which has indeed heightened the tendency to determine and allocate assistance on the basis of strategic East-West considerations that are completely irrelevant to the dire needs of the developing nations. The half-hearted approach which now seems to characterize international economic negotiation is probably the worst feature of the present crisis of multilateralism.
258.	A word about the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, held at Belgrade, is appropriate at this stage, since it was the most important negotiating conference held this year. We had hoped that the opportunity of the Belgrade meeting would be fully seized to deal decisively, effectively and in an integrated and global manner with the various problems of global trade and development, particularly the adverse situation facing the developing countries. Along with other members of the Group of 77, we went to Belgrade determined to be constructive and conciliatory, but we discovered to our utter dismay and disappointment that our partners in the North were in no mood for reciprocity. In the end what emerged from the Conference was a rehash of the results of previous sessions, with the addition of just a few half-measures, which did not amount to the serious package of urgent remedial and long-term measures that had been sought.
259.	It is clear that we have all missed yet another golden opportunity to take appropriate measures to revitalize the world economy and, in particular, the accelerated and sustained development of developing countries. The international community has delayed taking the necessary vital steps, however, and this has worsened the plight of both the strong and the weak. We therefore wonder how long our partners in the North, particularly the developed market economies, will continue to drag their feet with regard to the restructuring of international economic relations. Greater progress could undoubtedly be made in this regard through a better appreciation by the developed countries of the reality of interdependence and the fact that the developing countries as a group have become a significant partner in the international economy.
260.	The foregoing remarks are pertinent since they underscore the caution with which many have been inclined to receive reports about the economic upturn in certain developed countries. To us this is not a time for raising false expectations. Nor do we think that any trickle-down from the so-called recovery is the panacea for the grave economic problems facing the developing world. The deepening global crisis makes it ever more clear that We are dealing not with a mere cyclical phenomenon but with problems of structural maladjustments in various areas of international economic relations that require global and integrated solution.
261.	Unless the structural imbalance that lies at the heart of the current global economic crisis is redressed urgently through a major and concerted international effort, it not only will remain a source of friction in relations among nations but will also undermine the steady growth of the world economy. Four years ago it appeared that there was a recognition of the necessity for an international effort when the Assembly adopted by consensus resolution 34/138, on global negotiations relating to international economic co-operation for development. Unfortunately, nothing positive has happened since to permit the launching of the global negotiations. Rather, consultations on the matter have simply petered out, and the situation now is one of total impasse and deadlock.
262.	Responsibility for the failure to launch the global negotiations must rest with those countries which remain adamantly opposed to the idea. Now that this item is inscribed on the agenda of this session, all may not be lost yet. Together with other developing countries, we remain ready to engage in a constructive dialogue with the developed countries on this matter, in the belief that there is a mutuality of interests in seeking necessary reforms in the existing international economic order. We would therefore urge them to show the necessary political will in support of all efforts to facilitate progress towards the establishment of the new international economic order.
263.	Stability and peaceful coexistence cannot be achieved in a world where the overwhelming majority of mankind lives in abject poverty and penury, nor can sustained global economic growth be attained without the active participation of the developing nations. Since, therefore, everyone stands to benefit from an enduring recovery of the world economy, and knowing the catastrophe to which inaction or feeble efforts can lead, the international community must take swift action in putting together a package of measures, short-term and long- term, which respond to the needs of developing nations in particular. Commodity markets must be significantly strengthened through accelerated implementation of the integrated programme for commodities, including the early coming into force of the Agreement Establishing the Common Fund for Commodities, which my Government ratified recently. The rising tide of protectionism in the developed countries must be brought under control in the interest of world trade. There is also the imperative need to inject substantial and additional liquidity which responds to the needs of the world economy, particularly the accelerated growth of developing countries.
264.	Before concluding my statement, I should like to declare the total support of my Government and the people of Nigeria for the peace movement, whose members are now clamouring throughout the world for an end to the arms race. The deployment of an ever-increasing number of nuclear warheads and the militarization of outer space make the spectre of a global holocaust a real possibility. This sword of Damocles has become an intolerable burden on mankind. The recent Korean jet incident shows how easily the world could be plunged into a nuclear holocaust through a sheer military blunder.
265.	We must never allow a nuclear holocaust to happen. Collectively, we all have a responsibility to ensure that it does not, for the greatest tragedies have occurred not so much because of what was finally done as because of what had earlier foolishly been left undone.
 
	

1984
On behalf of the Nigerian delegation, I wish to congratulate you, Sir, on your unanimous election as President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. My delegation fully shares in the accolades and warm sentiments expressed by preceding speakers on your personal ability, competence and well-known achievements as an outstanding diplomat and untiring fighter for peace and freedom, I pay tribute to your dedicated service in the cause of the United Nations as the indefatigable President of the United Nations Council for Namibia and also to the consistent voice and role of your country in the common search for regional and global peace, justice and understanding. I feel confident that under your wise and able guidance this session will witness movement in most of the issues before the Assembly. It is therefore with great pleasure that I pledge to you the full support and co-operation of the delegation of Nigeria in the discharge of your difficult task.
94.	Permit me also to pay tribute to your eminent predecessor, Mr. Jorge Illueca, President of Panama, for the skilful manner in which he conducted the work of the thirty-eighth session of the Assembly.
95.	My gratitude also goes to our distinguished Secretary-General for his work on behalf of the Organization in the cause of world peace and for persistently drawing attention to the economic problems confronting the world, and particularly the economic problems of Africa.
96.	We welcome Brunei Darussalam to the comity of nations. Its admission as the 159th Member of the United Nations stands out as a reaffirmation of the principles of universality and self-determination, which constitute the corner-stones of the Organization. Nigeria extends its hand of goodwill to the new Member of this body and looks forward to working closely with Brunei Darussalam in the promotion of peace, progress, and economic and social justice in the world.
97.	The world is today gripped by fear and uncertainties arising from an unprecedented degree of tension in relations between the super-Powers and their allies. In particular, the unending cycle of the growing military competition between the superpowers has led to a new round of deployment of intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Europe, feverish work on new systems of strategic nuclear weapons and intensified research into anti-satellite weapons. Ominous calls for the fresh accumulation of chemical weapons are being made by the leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in a manner that is certain further to hinder the negotiations on a convention on chemical weapons. The result of this intensified competition is reflected in the enormous sum of almost $700 billion, which represents world military expenditure for 1983. All this race to destruction is proceeding notwithstanding the existing arsenals of the two super-Powers, which are enough to create a nuclear winter that will engulf both the northern and southern hemispheres and perhaps end all civilization. It is no longer only the imagination of those whom some may call alarmists but also the well-documented research of eminent scientists that have shown the possibility that up to half of humanity may be the immediate victim of a major nuclear war. The other half will, to a lesser or greater extent, become secondary victims sooner or later. What is sure is that there will be no hiding place for any of us even though we have no part in, and indeed have continued to warn against, this irrational diversion of human and material resources for the accumulation of these terrible weapons of destruction.
98.	For us in Africa it is particularly painful that this unprecedented threat to the existence of humanity coupled with greater diversion of resources should coincide with Africa's acute economic crisis. Natural calamities such as the widespread and persistent drought, the destabilizing policies of the apartheid regime of South Africa in relation to its neighbours, and the world economic recession, with the attendant selfish policies of the industrialized countries, have combined to produce a desperate economic condition, which alarmed the Secretary-General when he visited some African countries at the beginning of the year. True to his vocation, he immediately called the attention of the international community to the explosive situation and set up a high-powered group to make specific recommendations.
99.	The current economic crisis in Africa has its immediate as well as its medium- and long-term dimensions. The emergency aspect emanates mainly from the devastating impact of the drought, which within the last decade has progressively spread to areas hitherto not affected by it. The prolonged drought has exacerbated the already inadequate food situation in the region. Over the years, food production has lagged behind the increase in population, and by 1983 the drought-stricken countries were importing over 28.7 million tons of cereals, as against only 4 million tons in 1970.
100.	In addition to the climatic disaster suffered by African countries, there has been the profound impact of the adverse economic recession on the region. As the most exposed in the world, because of its unusually high degree of dependence on external sources for almost all critical and essential input for development activities, the African economy has been the principal victim of the global recession. The export earnings of African countries have tumbled with the collapse of commodity prices. The stagnation and decline in official development assistance in real terms and the increasing privatization of capital flows have hit Africa hardest, while escalating debt and debt-servicing and unprecedentedly high interest rates have spelt financial disaster for most of the countries of the continent.
101.	Recognizing that the primary responsibility for the development of their economies rests on themselves, African countries have looked inwards and, at the tenth meeting of the Conference of Ministers of the Economic Commission for Africa, held in May 1984, their Ministers of economic development and planning formulated and adopted a Special Memorandum on Africa's Economic and Social Crisis,6 which is a framework for action for dealing with the crisis in its emergency, short-, medium- and long-term dimensions. This was closely followed by the Conference of African Ministers of Finance, held at Addis Ababa from 18 to 20 June 1984, during which the Addis Ababa Declaration on Africa's External Indebtedness was adopted10 to focus special attention on the region's growing external debt of over $ 150 billion and to suggest ways to address the problem concretely.
102.	Africa is not alone in feeling the crushing impact of the severe debt crisis. Most developing countries have had to bear the same burden. The huge size of the debt of the developing countries and its impact on their economies make it imperative for the international community, as well as the international financial institutions, to address the subject with urgency and great imagination. In this connection, we recognize the important role of the IMF in helping members cope with their balance-of-payments problems. However, in so doing, the IMF should endeavour to show greater flexibility in its approach when prescribing adjustment programmes for each country.
103.	Unfortunately, the experiences of several developing countries, including my own that have had to resort to the IMF have shown a certain deliberate insensitivity on its part to the possible consequences of its prescribed package as the price for its loan. Let me hasten to say that the present military regime in Nigeria accepts, and has indeed taken the initiative in instituting, realistic sacrifices to turn back the slide in the economy. However, such sacrifices must be within tolerable economic and social limits. The application of the IMF's conditions is unfortunately rather stereotyped and should be reviewed with the objective of paying more attention than ever before to the underlying circumstances of each State, in order to prevent severe and avoidable unrest stemming from the corrective measures and to provide the stability necessary for the achievement of the State's domestic economic, social and political goals. It is a bad doctor indeed who prescribes the same medicine for all his patients, irrespective of their ailments. This is what the IMF has been doing.
104.	As we observe the world economic situation unfold, what emerges for most developing countries, particularly African countries, is that prospects of significant progress are extremely bleak. Even though it is being said that recovery by most industrialized countries from the recent global economic recession has manifested itself and taken hold, we must continue to ask when the light at the end of the dark economic tunnel will appear for developing countries. It is now clear that recovery in other regions does not necessarily produce a positive impetus or act as a catalyst, even in tentative forms, for economic development in developing countries, because of the fundamental barriers to their participation in international economic activities.
105.	We cannot run away from the truth that for genuine economic recovery to take place in the world there must be willingness on the part of all members of the international community to redress those structural imbalances that contribute and condemn African and other developing countries to a life of poverty and economic underdevelopment.
106.	The only way that vigorous global economic growth can be achieved and sustained over time is by the active participation of all countries, developed and developing, in mutually beneficial and equal partnership in global economic processes and activities. This calls for the adoption and the faithful implementation of a package of measures, both short- and long-term, which truly respond to the needs of all countries and regions, and of developing countries in particular. There must be a deliberate attempt and effort to resist the growing tendency to resort to protectionism, in the interests of a truly free world trade. The drift from the multilateral spirit must be arrested. We cannot reduce international relations increasingly to the bilateral level in a tumultuous world such as this one. Let us bear in mind that universal understanding and willingness to co-operate have been—and still can be—an engine for so much change and so much good. We must not, therefore, wittingly or unwittingly, turn our backs on this rich heritage and reservoir of multilateral partnership which holds so much hope for our universe. We must return to the spirit of co-operation which is enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.
107.	It is for this reason that Nigeria, along with other members of the Group of 77, has consistently underscored the necessity for a global dialogue that will lead to reform of the structural imbalance which lies at the heart of the global economic malaise. My Government strongly believes that, until the structural imbalance in the economic relations between countries is redressed, friction and ill-will will remain to trouble and undermine the real and steady growth of the world economy. It is, therefore, unfortunate that, in spite of almost five years of strenuous efforts, nothing positive has taken place to permit the launching of the global negotiations. My delegation appeals to the Assembly to live up to the spirit of the Charter and embark on a course that will permit the early launching of genuine negotiations, so as to accelerate the attainment of the new international economic order.
108.	The situation in southern Africa, particularly the question of apartheid and the issue of the independence of Namibia, is as explosive as ever. The inhuman system of apartheid, which is at the heart of the southern African problem, continues to thrive and to develop deep roots, partly through the manoeuvres of the apartheid regime, but also thanks to the support of certain Members of the United Nations. Those Member States, which profess a commitment to freedom and human rights and which therefore, should be in the vanguard of the struggle to eliminate apartheid, have unfortunately chosen to appease and reinforce that inhuman system through their open collaboration with it. How else are we to interpret the visit by the leader of the apartheid regime to Portugal, Belgium, the Federal Republic of Germany and the United Kingdom and the warm reception accorded to him? By their action, these countries have helped Botha to break out of the isolation to which the international community had condemned him and his inhuman regime.
109.	There seems to be a well-orchestrated attempt to hoodwink the world about a non-existent process of democratization in South Africa. It is a strange democracy which enshrines in its constitution the exclusion from the electoral process of 23 million blacks, who constitute over 73 per cent of the population. We are therefore not surprised that the Coloureds and the Asians, whom the apostles of apartheid tried to delude, saw through the mask and massively boycotted the elections in their separate assemblies. That was an eloquent verdict on the so-called constitutional reform. The non-white people of South Africa have refused to be fooled. The international community has endorsed their judgement and unreservedly condemned this chicanery. However, the international community should go further and totally reject the deceptive image of peace-maker in southern Africa which South Africa tries so hard to project. By a sheer war of attrition, by aggression, by sabotage and by every conceivable means of destabilization, South Africa has succeeded in forcing unequal agreements on some of its neighbours. Even as the General Assembly is in session, the apartheid regime is continuing to exert pressure on Lesotho to enter into a defence pact with it.
110.	South Africa is unrelenting in its bellicose posture, its subversion and its expansionist policies. Its post-Nkomati tactic has been to deceive the other party to the so-called non-aggression pact. In spite of that pact, South Africa has surreptitiously strengthened the Mozambique National Resistance Movement. The consequence of this has been an increase of pressure on the Government of Mozambique and the stage-managing of another sham truce. Last week's scenario, which was intended to create a cease-fire, was hypocritical and clearly promoted South Africa's ultimate objective of destabilization of the entire region. The world community must not allow an illegitimate regime, which tortures, dehumanizes, denationalizes and engages in numerous other atrocities against humanity, to assume for itself the mantle of a regional peace-maker and peace- broker.
111. The Government of Nigeria calls upon the international community to play a decisive role in the liquidation of apartheid. This is an inescapable obligation to Africa and to the world as a whole. Nigeria wants to make it abundantly clear that appeasement, concession and accommodation will only set back the clock of progress towards the final liquidation of apartheid.
112.	Let South Africa be warned that, notwithstanding the millions of dollars spent on subverting and misleading world public opinion and the world's conscience, one thing is certain: it will not get away with its heinous crimes against humanity.
113.	Let the international community bear in mind that in this age of global interdependence no one will be spared the consequences of a racial war in southern Africa. Let the world know that history will not fail to record the Western world's unpardonable neglect of its responsibility to Africa, to the international community and to the United Nations over this issue of apartheid and racial discrimination in South Africa.
114.	Nigeria has always been in the forefront of the struggle to wipe out apartheid. The present federal Government, in its determination to explore new ways to combat apartheid, sponsored, together with the Special Committee against Apartheid, a Seminar on the Legal Status of the Apartheid Regime and Other Legal Aspects of the Struggle against Apartheid, held at Lagos from 13 to 16 August 1984. The seminar brought together jurists and social scientists representing the main legal systems all over the world.
115.	In its Declaration, the seminar concluded that the institution and operation of apartheid made the South African Government a colonial regime; that its constitution, unique in the world, excluded the overwhelming majority from the exercise of sovereignty, specifically because they were of indigenous origin. Thus, the 23 million Africans in South Africa, representing 73 per cent of the population, have been treated as a colonialized people since the Union of South Africa was created in 1910. The seminar accepted that apartheid, the most monstrous form of racial dis-crimination, which also contains elements of genocide, constituted a special case of the violation of jus cogens. Moreover, the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid, adopted in 1973, linked that crime to a serious threat to international peace and security and imposed international criminal responsibility on all who committed the crime of apartheid and their accomplices. The seminar agreed that the General Assembly, speaking for the international community, was entitled to proclaim the South African regime as having placed itself in a situation of illegality. By its persistent violation of jus cogens, the South African regime has therefore isolated itself from the system of fundamental values which constitute the very essence of the international community. A State Member of the United Nations which has placed itself in a situation of illegality could be and should be expelled from the Organization.
116.	Those are the conclusions of eminent jurists from all over the world. The General Assembly must take appropriate action.
117.	Fourteen years ago, the Assembly rejected the credentials of South Africa because those who purported to represent that country were in fact unrepresentative. Ten years ago, the General Assembly adopted resolution 3207 (XXIX), in which it called upon the Security Council 'to review the relationship between the United Nations and South Africa in the light of the constant violation by South Africa of the principles of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.'
118.	The Security Council considered in depth the request of the General Assembly, and it was clear that the overwhelming majority of members concluded that the application of Article 6 of the Charter of the United Nations was the answer. A draft resolution to that effect was, most unfortunately, vetoed by three permanent members of the Council—France, the United Kingdom and the United States. Thus, the apartheid regime continues to enjoy the honour of membership of an organization whose basic norms it violates. With a solid legal opinion to proceed upon, the United Nations should now be in a position to rid itself, once and for all, of this canker. The time for the expulsion of South Africa from the United Nations is overdue.
119.	Another component of the problem of southern Africa is the issue of the independence of Namibia. The efforts of the international community to achieve independence for Namibia have been consistently frustrated by the intransigence of South Africa, through the introduction of extraneous considerations. Recently we have witnessed nefarious attempts by the South African regime to settle the Namibian question outside the framework of the United Nations. The question of Namibia is a classic case of decolonization, falling squarely within the purview of the United Nations; therefore, any attempt to bring about the independence of Namibia outside the framework of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) constitutes a serious challenge to the international community and must not be allowed to succeed; otherwise, we shall be abdicating our responsibility towards the oppressed people of Namibia.
120.	My Government totally rejects the pernicious attempts to establish a link between the withdrawal of Cuban defensive forces in Angola and the independence of Namibia. The United Nations must take positive action to end South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia and bring about the immediate and unconditional implementation of resolution 435 (1978).
121.	Turning to the Middle East, we note with regret that the situation today remains as volatile as it has been in previous years. The question of Palestine, which is the core of the problem, has so far defied a just, equitable and comprehensive solution, owing largely to the continued intransigence of Israel and the total support which it receives from the United States.
122.	The international community has in the recent past witnessed the futility of attempting to find a military solution or of imposing a lopsided superpower solution to the Middle East problem. The invasion of Lebanon by Israel in 1982 and the tragic failure of the ill-advised mission of the so-called multinational force in Lebanon are both classic examples of the limits to the use of military power.
123.	The solution lies in a negotiated peace, a peace that is just, equitable and fair, a peace that recognizes the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self- determination, to return to their homeland and to establish their own independent State in Palestine. The United Nations has already called for such a negotiated peace. The International Conference on the Question of Palestine, held at Geneva from 29 August to 7 September 1983, called among other things for the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East. Such a conference should include the Palestinians themselves, the other interested parties in the region, the Soviet Union and the United States. We strongly support that proposal and call upon the United Nations to convene such a conference without further delay. We also call upon the international community and upon all concerned, particularly Israel and its supporters, to respond positively to this challenge of peace, under the auspices of the United Nations. To conclude in advance that such a conference will be unfair to any of the parties is to underrate the determination of the United Nations to find a permanent solution to this problem.
124.	The situation in Kampuchea also remains troubling. We urge the Secretary-General and the Ad Hoc Committee of the International Conference on Kampuchea to redouble their efforts to find a comprehensive political solution to the problem. Such a solution should be based on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations which call for respect for national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity for all States, non-recourse to the threat or use of force in international relations, and the peaceful settlement of disputes. On this basis, my delegation supports the relevant General Assembly resolution on Kampuchea , which called, among other things, for the convening of an international conference on Kampuchea, with the participation of all the conflicting parties and other interested parties, with the aim of finding a comprehensive political solution to the Kampuchean problem. We also strongly support the call for the total withdrawal of all foreign troops from Kampuchea and for the strict observance of fundamental human rights, which should lead to the holding of United Nations supervised free elections that will enable the people of Kampuchea to exercise their right of self- determination and restore peace and stability to the region.
125.	The unsettled political situation in almost every part of the world is unfortunate evidence of the persistent violation of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, whose fortieth anniversary we plan to commemorate next year. Whether in southern Africa or the Middle East, whether in South-East Asia or Central America, whether in Korea or Cyprus, the resort to force or the threat of the use of force, the violation of the right of self-determination and the violation of the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States continue to pose a severe threat to international peace and security. But much more alarming is the escalation of the arms race, particularly the nuclear arms race.
126.	The world, which is our common heritage, is being ominously imperilled by the nuclear-arms race, which has become the pastime of a few countries. There is great apprehension, which is fast becoming panic that the world is on the brink of a catastrophe of immense and universal proportions arising from the unprecedented nuclear rivalry of the two superpowers. No country can afford to be unconcerned about the present precarious situation, which may give the super-Powers and their allies cause for doctrinal or strategic satisfaction but which for the rest of the world evokes a constant nightmare. The concept of security, in the eyes of the super-Powers, is unfortunately related to the narrow interests of their alliances. The rest of the world is expected to feel secure as long as the two super-Powers continue their nuclear balancing act in the name of the doctrine of deterrence.
127.	The fact that the need to ensure peace and security globally may be unrelated to the level of nuclear armament is totally ignored by the superpowers in their pursuit of the ever-elusive parity in nuclear-weapons deployment. Yet, as the Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries stated during their Seventh Conference, held at New Delhi in March 1983, it is unacceptable that the security of all States and the very survival of mankind should be held hostage to the security interests of a handful of nuclear-weapon States. Nuclear disarmament and the prevention of nuclear war must therefore remain a priority task for the international community, particularly at this time when detente has collapsed and confrontation has become the watchword of the super-Powers. The General Assembly must insist that active negotiations on nuclear disarmament be resumed at the bilateral level between the super-Powers. The Assembly should also deplore the hindrances being placed in the way of meaningful negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament.
128.	In this connection, Nigeria believes that the super-Powers must show determination to undertake the most basic step towards the non-proliferation, both vertical and horizontal, of nuclear weapons. Over the years, such a basic step has been identified as the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test- ban treaty. It is already 21 years since the conclusion of the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water,' in which the parties expressed the objective of 'Seeking to achieve the discontinuance of all test explosions of nuclear weapons for all time'. The General Assembly has since made the achievement of the test-ban treaty the topmost priority. All the technical studies that can facilitate the conclusion of such an agreement have been undertaken. Yet no progress has been made. The vital missing element is the political will on the part of some nuclear-weapon States to reach an agreement. Yet it must be made clear that those who obstruct the conclusion of a nuclear-test-ban treaty cannot at the same time claim to be the champions of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. For so long as they show unwillingness to honour their commitment under article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons whereby they undertook 'to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament ...' for so long will they constitute impediments to an effective non-proliferation regime. If the viability of the Non-Proliferation Treaty is to be maintained, the nuclear-weapon States must, in the course of this session of the General Assembly, commit themselves firmly to negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty.
129.	It is clear from all available evidence that the only effective defence against nuclear weapons is never to use them; any use would constitute the greatest crime against humanity. To that end, the decision of the General Assembly with regard to negotiations on a convention on the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons should be pursued with the utmost vigour. Any obstacle placed in the way of the work of the Conference on Disarmament in this respect should be seen as a great disservice to the maintenance of international peace and security. Similarly, negotiations on the prevention of an arms race in outer space and on a convention on chemical weapons should be an urgent concern of the international community . Progress in these areas is of the utmost importance for global security.
130.	I have highlighted some of the major problems facing the international community today in the belief that we can honestly work together to solve them. The United Nations serves as a unique forum for the promotion of understanding and peace among all nations. It also provides a unique opportunity for Member States to engage in constructive dialogue and co-operation in our common quest for a better world. We must, therefore, strive to work together to uphold the principles of the Charter in the interest of mankind. I am confident that, with determination and given the necessary political will, we can overcome all obstacles in the way of lasting international peace and security and the achievement of an equitable international economic order.



1985

Mr. President, in the name of the Nigerian delegation, I would like to avail myself of this opportunity to congratulate the President warmly on his election to the presidency of the fortieth session of the General Assembly. His long and distinguished experience in the United Nations gives us confidence that he will most competently guide the deliberations of the Assembly. I wish him every success in the months ahead.
I would also like to pay tribute to his predecessor, Ambassador Paul Lusaka, for the excellent manner in which he presided over the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. In the same vein, permit me, Mr. President, to express my thanks and appreciation to our distinguished Secretary-General, for his untiring efforts in the service of the international community.
My Government has already expressed its deep condolence to the Government and people of Mexico on the recent earthquake. May I, however, take this opportunity to appeal to the international community to show solidarity with Mexico in the true spirit of human brotherhood.
Throughout the world the fortieth anniversary of the funding of the United Nations is being observed with mixed feelings. There is much to cheer and applaud in the record of the United Nations. Forty years after its founding, the world is much better off with, than without, the United Nations. The Organization has achieved a lot in the areas of decolonization, human rights, health, peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance. The specialized agencies in the system have improved the quality of life of millions of people throughout the world, within their areas of competence.
These accomplishments, however, are overshadowed by the threat to human existence arising from super-Power nuclear rivalry, the unsettled political situation in almost every part of the world, and the constant decline in the economic condition of the majority of the world's population. Yet, the effectiveness of the United Nations to cope with these global problems seems to be at an all-time low. The Organization is being gripped by a paralysis which is indicative of the determination of some powerful Members to avoid the constraints of multilateralism, the more easily to be able to impose unilateral solutions to international problems
The United Nations is at a cross-roads. Its Members are faced with two options. We can continue along the present path of rendering the Organization increasingly ineffective and irrelevant to the crucial issues of our time. That is a choice that can lead only to catastrophe. Alternatively,, we can choose to revitalize the Organization, to enhance its effectiveness and to make it live up to the hopes conceived by the founding fathers. The requirement of survival dictates that we choose this second option. The United Nations must be revitalized and strengthened. For this to happen we have to confront collectively the political as well as the structural crises afflicting it. Since the Organization is a structure of our own creation and a tool in our own hands, it can be effective only to the extent that Members allow it to be. This fortieth session should be an opportunity for us all to demonstrate the political will that is the basic ingredient of revitalization. The permanent members of the Security Council, who, under the Charter, have the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, will particularly have to demonstrate the will to find a new approach more consonant with the universal hope reposed in the United Nations.
The time is ripe for new initiatives to prevent this Organization from being paralyzed and to prevent cold-war suspicions and considerations from holding back the evolution of solutions to the pressing problems of mankind. Let us never despair of building bridges between protagonists. Let us never despair of thinking thoughts and dreaming dreams in an endeavor to bring sanity to the world. This responsibility does not rest with the big Powers alone; it rests with all of us.
The primary purpose of the United Nations is the promotion and maintenance of international peace and security. In its 40 years of existence no world war has broken out. That is something worth cheering. However, there have been and still are several localized wars in many parts of the globe. These wars have claimed more lives than the Second World War. Moreover, they have been and are being fought in the Third World, in areas least able to afford the accompanying destruction and devastation. Even when the signs of the outbreak of such wars are seen, the United Nations, in particular the Security Council, is rendered incapable of taking preventive action in accordance with the Charter. The Organization therefore often looks on helplessly while wars break out and are fought for as long as the antagonists want. Collective security, which was predicated on a degree of consensus among the major Powers, has given way to a polarization of the world into two rival alliances each of which has developed the concept of security based on the competitive accumulation of nuclear weapons. As a result of this arms race, the world is faced with the ultimate peril of total destruction.
For the first time in the history of the human race man has within his power and capability the means by which he could annihilate many times over the whole of life on earth. Rather than enhancing security, the accumulation of nuclear weapons has become the greatest source of global danger. Yet the super-Powers that are responsible for this very grave situation are not disposed to show any serious commitment to reducing the levels of such weapons in the interest of the survival of humanity. Let it not be said that the United Nations has not constantly drawn attention to that danger. In two special sessions devoted to disarmament and in countless resolutions adopted at its regular sessions the General Assembly has not only characterized in vivid terms the danger posed by nuclear weapons but drawn up several programs of action for the attainment of general and complete disarmament.
The response and reaction of the super-Powers have been in stark contrast to the urgency of the situation. To be sure, they make a lot of notion about negotiations. However, the international community cannot be blamed if it now sees these negotiations as no more than exercises in public relations. In some cases these efforts are even designed to buy more time to design and manufacture more dreadful weapons of mass destruction.
Nuclear disarmament is a global issue in which all. states have a vital stake, It cannot and should not, therefore, be left exclusively the hands of the two super-Powers. The United Nations, representing the peoples of the world, should keep up the pressure to bring ^bout a halt to the nuclear arms race and to proceed to nuclear disarmament. The very survival of all our countries and all our peoples is at stake.
Another major threat to international peace and security that has defied United Nations efforts is apartheid, that iniquitous practice which has rightly been termed a crime against humanity. The danger inherent in the practice was first brought to the attention of the United Nations General Assembly at its third session. Since then apartheid has thrived on the support of certain powerful Members of this Organization whose concern for high returns on investments in South Africa outweighs their global responsibility. By a series of oppressive laws and the naked practice of State terrorism, successive regimes in apartheid South Africa have violated every conceivable law of human decency. In the process also the Pretoria clique has constituted itself into a veritable menace to the neighboring States, disturbing the peace and security of the entire southern African region. My Government has condemned in no uncertain terms the latest violation of the territorial integrity of Angola by South Africa. Nigeria pledges its unflinching support to those sister African States that are victims of the racist regime.
As if to emphasize their disgust at the failure of the United Nations to take effective action against apartheid, the people of South Africa have decided to make whatever sacrifice is required to liquidate apartheid. As a result of the spontaneous uprising of the past few months, it now appears that the count-down to the collapse of apartheid has at least started. Oppression by the white rulers has reached the point where it has forced all segments of the oppressed to rebel.
This is not the first time that blacks have reacted to their subjugation. What is different is the evident determination, even in the face of panic emergency measures, to press on. It is significant that the trigger-point to the current wave of mass action was the so-called constitutional reform whereby the apartheid regime thought it could perpetuate its oppression by granting some meaningless concessions to the Coloreds and the Asians. Characteristically, the apartheid regime thought it could, without reaction, continue to ignore the 21 million blacks. That was its crowning folly, for it totally misjudged the mood of the black people of South Africa.
The mass revolt which has involved workers, students, even school children, and the clergy, has caught the apartheid regime off guard. Its response, again true to character, was to introduce more draconian laws in the form of declaring a state of emergency. Two points should now be clear to the apologists for the apartheid regime: first, that the racist regime is in no mood to seek a peaceful accommodation with the majority blacks for a framework for the establishment of a democratic society in South Africa based on equality of all races. Mr. Botha's long awaited speech of 15 August 1985 gave not the slightest indication of a disposition towards meaningful change. Those States Members of the United Nations, which rather than support effective action against the apartheid regime delude themselves about possible persuasion of the regime, should by now see that they are mistaken. The ruling clique in Pretoria will not give up except as the result of concerted pressure of international action in support of the internal revolt of South Africans.
Secondly, the continuous mass actions of the black Africans, despite brutal police and military killings, should by now have convinced outsiders that no sacrifice is considered too great to make for their liberty and human dignity. It is especially important to emphasize this point since unwillingness to support effective economic sanctions against South Africa is often camouflaged by the spurious argument of its effects on black South Africans and on neighboring countries. The present economic system in South Africa is based on the deprivation of blacks and the exploitation of their labor. It is one of the pillars of the apartheid system. To dismantle apartheid, a change in the system is inevitable. Let those who oppose sanctions but protest their abhorrence of apartheid know that they are guilty of double-talk.
On this fortieth anniversary of the United Nations let us resolve to bring hope to the oppressed South Africans. Let the Security Council meet and impose mandatory economic sanctions on South Africa in accordance with Chapter VII of the Charter. Let all the permanent members of the Security Council support sanctions in discharging the onerous responsibility bestowed on them by the Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security. Let all Members of the United Nations give total support for sanctions, bearing in mind that the alternative will be a bloodbath of unspeakable proportions. Today I call upon the principal trading partners of South Africa to co-operate and assist the process of genuine change in South Africa that may still be achieved without mass bloodshed.
Nineteen years ago on 27 October 1966 the General Assembly, under resolution 2145 (XI), terminated South Africa's mandate over Namibia and assumed direct responsibility over the Territory. Since then the United Nations, through the General Assembly and the Security Council, has adopted numerous resolutions and decisions all aimed at finding a peaceful, just and acceptable solution of the Namibian question. The landmark of these efforts was the adoption by the Security Council in 1978 of resolution 435 (1978) which embodied a plan for the independence of Namibia.
Despite all the efforts of the United Nations, the question of Namibia remains unresolved and the racist Pretoria regime continues to occupy Namibia illegally and to exploit its human and natural resources in contravention of Decree No. 1 enacted by the United Nations Council for Namibia. Unfortunately, South Africa has been able to count on the support of a powerful Member of this Organization in its continued defiance of the United Nations over Namibia. By linking Namibia's independence to the withdrawal of Cuban defensive forces in Angola, South Africa has been provided with a cover with which to perpetuate its atrocities in Namibia.
Insistence on extraneous and irrelevant issues as a precondition for the independence of Namibia is totally unacceptable to my Government. Namibia to us is a classic case of colonialism that must be resolved as such. It should not become a victim of the ideological rivalry of the super-Powers. The South African presence in Namibia must be seen for what it is. It is an illegal occupation by a latter-day imperialist Power that seeks every excuse to perpetuate its illegality and deny the Namibian people their right to self-determination. South Africa must be compelled to co-operate with the United Nations in implementing resolution 435 (1978).
Another area where the United Nations has failed to achieve a solution is the Middle East. It is a problem as old as the United Nations itself. Yet we appear to be no nearer to a solution today than we were in previous years just because some of those involved do not face the realities of the situation. Hew can the Palestinians be ignored if there is to be a viable solution? Just as the security of all States in the region is an indispensable element in a durable solution, so also should be the recognition of the inalienable rights of all people in the region. That includes the Palestinians. A solution that is just, fair and equitable will have to recognize, inter alia, the inalienable right of the Palestinians to self-determination. An international conference cm the Middle East is widely considered as the most appropriate forum for such a negotiated solution. Nigeria appeals to those countries which continue to oppose such a conference to reconsider their position. If the present stalemate is to be broken, all concerned should appreciate that unilateral measures are no substitute for the collective wisdom of the United Nations.
Other trouble spots abound to remind us of the danger posed to peace and security in various parts of the world in this fortieth year of the United Nations. Afghanistan, Kampuchea and Central America, for instance, are sad reminders of unacceptable big Power intervention and interference in the affairs of small neighbors. This is an appropriate juncture in the annals of the United Nations to call for strict adherence to the principle of sovereign equality of States and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of every State, big or small. Nigeria therefore reiterates its support for the efforts aimed at establishing in Afghanistan and Kampuchea a stable and durable peace based on the withdrawal of all foreign forces and strict respect for the right of the peoples of those two countries to choose through free elections their Governments and re-establish firmly their non-aligned status.
As for Central America, it behooves us all to support the efforts of the countries of Latin America to find a solution to problems in the subregion. All acts of aggression, overt or covert, must cease. All forms of economic sabotage directed against any country must end. The Contadora Group must be encouraged to pursue its initiative, which represents an important step towards lasting peace. We therefore urge the Governments of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua to show the political will to conclude negotiations on the Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America.
At a time when the increasing Interdependence of countries calls for greater co-operation between them in the spirit and framework of the Charter that was adopted 40 years ago at San Francisco, we are instead witnessing the painful abandonment of those noble and worthy goals of the United Nations. We are witnessing a steady erosion of confidence in the multilateral system created in the post-war period. Further, we are witnessing a relentless attack on the United Nations system, which is at the center of existing multilateral arrangements. Today the role of the United Nations in providing a universal forum for economic problems facing the international community is continuously disrupted, bypassed and even ignored. Indeed, it has become more apparent than ever before that the United Nations system is the focus of the current challenge to multilateralism. Violations, often flagrant, of- the principles and norms which underpin the multilateral system have helped to weaken its ability to provide a viable framework for international economic co-operation for development, as envisaged by the Charter.
A concomitant feature of the decline in multilateralism has been the marked resurgence of unilateral approaches to economic problems that have global ramifications. What is of the utmost concern to my delegation is the adverse impact on the developing countries of the unilateral decisions and acts of the powerful actors in the global economy. Such actions, by definition, are bound to be arbitrary and extremely self-serving. It is therefore not surprising in the least that they tend to violate basic economic agreements and concepts which they themselves have invested with the cloak of sacred economic doctrine and international law. Some of these unilateral actions include high interest rates, volatile exchange rates, protectionism, measures that result in deteriorating terms of trade for the developing countries, and refusal to vies with sympathy the external debts of developing countries which have resulted in the net export of capital to the developed countries.
All those factors are symptomatic of a dangerous movement towards a new de facto multilateral economic framework quite incapable of dealing with the great global economic problems of our time, both in their medium-term and long-term prospects, we reiterate that global problems, be they in the areas of trade, commodities, money and finance, or debt, demand global solutions. To achieve this goal we must effectively employ the mechanisms and instruments that are available to the international community, namely, the institutions of the United Nations system. We must go back to the true spirit of the Charter of the United Nations in ensuring and sustaining vibrant multilateral economic co-operation. Nigeria believes that the occasion of this fortieth anniversary of our Organization is an appropriate time for the renewal of and rededication to the multilateral spirit.
In reaffirming our commitment to the multilateral approach, Nigeria calls for the resumption of an honest and serious North-South dialog on issues of international economic co-operation for development. During the last decade we witnessed, with profound regret, many missed opportunities resulting in the lack of significant progress in all sectors. Clearly there is an urgent need to create, nurture and sustain a favorable climate of genuine dialog and consensus. There is a need to allay unfounded fears of each other's intentions. We believe that flexibility in our various positions, coupled with the necessary political will, is required to permit the restructuring of the world economy in a mutually advantageous manner, as called for in the new international economic order. Global negotiations, stalled as a result of one ruse after another for the past five years, in spite of the sincerity demonstrated by the Group of 77, must be launched immediately.
The world economic situation continues to be fragile even though we are in the third year of the recovery. It is new generally agreed that the recovery, which at best remains uneven and unbalanced, has failed to have any visible positive effects on world trade and the economies of the developing countries, thus proving beyond any doubt the ineptness of the trickle-down theory. There are uncertainties about the immediate prospects as protectionist pressures and attitudes in the major industrialized countries refuse to abate, giving rise to policies which can only further choke the feeble growth signals in the developing countries. We are therefore concerned about the adverse effects of the general macro-economic policies of the major industrialized countries on the economies of the developing countries. It is obvious to all that there is no effective surveillance over the major industrialized countries whose policies have the greatest impact on the international economy and whose unilateral actions and policies continue to destabilize the multilateral regime. We must realize that a world where the many are poor and the few are rich is a world of iniquity; it is a recipe for instability. So let us together examine seriously ways and means of bringing about prosperity, not for a few, but for all. Let us re-examine the international financial institutions with the purpose of making them purveyors of prosperity rather than economic and political ruin.
The burden of debt which has become unbearable in financial terms for many developing countries need not be further compounded by social and political upheavals. How can a developing country like mine spend about 45 per cent of its export earnings on debt servicing and still be expected to satisfy the basic needs of its teeming population as well as achieve sustained economic growth? Our creditors must realize that it is in their interest as well as ours that we survive.
Let me now turn to the special challenge which the critical economic situation in Africa poses for the conscience of mankind and the international community. By adopting a Declaration on the situation at its thirty-ninth session, this Assembly recognized the gravity of the terrible tragedy that was unfolding on the continent and the need for the whole world to stand up as one to combat the situation. One year has elapsed and we cannot pay enough tribute to the tremendous response by the international community to the relief aspect of the crisis. The overwhelmingly sympathetic and active public opinion in the donor countries not only attests to the brotherhood of man but has also helped to keep interest in the situation alive and to permit sustained, action by their home Governments. The generosity of which the human spirit is capable when aroused is a welcome testimony to the goodness that mankind is capable of. A great amount of food aid and allied requisites were provided and, without question, numerous lives were saved. We applaud the manifest international goodwill which this relief assistance has exemplified and hope that this will be intensified in the future as the situation in many African countries still remains critical and life-threatening under the specter of starvation and hunger. Indeed, at the present time, emergency requirements of over $1.5 billion for 1985 are still unmet for the 18 most seriously affected countries.
While on the whole the donor response to the emergency dimensions of the crisis has been commendable, it is much to be regretted that very little, if any, effort has been directed towards the longer-term and structural problems of the African economy, we view with enormous concern the reluctance of the international community to deal with the fundamental problems of economic development faced by African countries. As the Nigerian delegation pointed out at the second regular session of the Economic and Social Council, in July, when this item came before the Council for the second year in a row as its priority item, it is precisely in the vital area of long-term measures that the response of the international community and the United Nations system has been the weakest. No serious and co-ordinated .effort has been made to interface the current global response to the emergency situation with the longer-term development needs of the African continent.
We call for urgent action by the international community addressed specifically to such structural problems as food and agricultural production, drought and desertification, declining financial, particularly official development assistance, flows and, last but not least, the heavy external debts of the African region, we firmly believe that the rehabilitation and restoration of the process of growth and development is impossible in the absence of intensive and effective action on these major long-term problems faced by African countries. We call strongly for the adoption of a new development consensus by the international community on behalf of Africa to pave the way for this concerted global action. We believe that this is a call without equivocation and that it should be possible for donors to accept this challenge nobly and liberally in the same manner as they demonstrated in meeting the requirements of the emergency. We further believe that the capacity to do so exists. We therefore call for the necessary political will to make this possible. It should be clear, since there can bS.no mistake about this, that African countries accept that the primary responsibility for dealing with the critical economic situation and for relaunching the development process in the continent lies with them. The 21st session of the Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Organization of African Unity, held at Addis Ababa in July and devoted mainly to the discussion of the critical economic situation of their region, demonstrated the commitment of Africa's leaders and peoples to the economic development and self-reliance of the continent. Accordingly, the summit meeting adopted both a Declaration and a far-reaching five-year priority program of action for the accelerated development of Africa. We commend this action program for the sustained support of the international community and in this light we welcome the positive tone of resolution 1985/80, on the critical economic situation in Africa, adopted by the Economic and Social Council at its second regular session. In addition, we wish to highlight the appeals made by the summit meeting for the convening of an international conference on Africa's debt and a special session of the General Assembly to discuss Africa's critical economic situation. We believe that these are extremely important calls from Africa which deserve the full support of the international community.
I should like to state again that, in spite of its shortcomings, the existence of the United Nations in the past 40 years has made the world a better place than it was in the pre-United Nations years. But a lot more needs to be done. Confidence in the Organization has eroded; the Organization has been ignored and heavily criticized. Its effectiveness has consequently been sapped. We need to revitalize the Organization by rededicating ourselves to the ideals enshrined in the Charter, in particular by collectively demonstrating in a practical way the political will to act. We must restore confidence in the United Nations as the main framework for multilateral co-operation in the world. We must collectively revitalize the Organization and create a political atmosphere that will be conducive to the pursuit and realization of global peace and security, as well as the promotion of economic growth and development.



1986
On behalf of the Nigerian delegation, I take this opportunity. Sir, to extend to you my congratulations on your unanimous and well-deserved election as President of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. My delegation shares fully the warm sentiments expressed by previous speakers on your personal outstanding merits. I am confident that under your wise guidance this session will achieve significant success.
It is therefore with great pleasure that I pledge the full support and co-operation of my delegation to you in the discharge of your difficult task, particularly at this tine, when, more than ever. Member States need to act in concert to attain an era of peace that will give a new direction to the course of human destiny. May I also extend my congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Jaise Pinies, your predecessor, for the able manner in which he handled the affairs of the fortieth session and thirteenth special session.
I should also like to salute our Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, who, I am happy to see, has been restored to health. There can be no gainsaying that the best assurance of support we can give the Secretary-General is a revitalized United Nations.
The relevance of the United Nations to the solution of urgent global problems is certainly not in contention. The devotion of the Organization to the maintenance of international peace and security has been balanced by an appreciation of the need to promote the economic and social well-being of mankind.
In its 41-year history, the United Nations has gone beyond pious statements delivered with great solemnity in this Hall to the endorsement and implementation of action-oriented measures. Its achievements are legion. From successful peace-keeping operations in conflict areas around the world to the decolonization of Africa and Asia and the various activities and projects of its specialized agencies, the United Nations has become an effective instrument of international co-operation and development.
Yet this cherished Organization is currently undergoing the gravest crisis in its history. Some call it a crisis of multilateralism. Others define it as a financial crisis. Fundamentally, it is a political crisis inflicted on the United Nations by its membership. Disagreements about the management and control of the Organization's budget and the determination of its programs are mere symptoms of a deeper difference in perceptions of the role and capability of the United Nations.
Paradoxically, the present crisis is a welcome development to the extent that it provides us an opportunity to re-evaluate the activities and procedures of the United Nations. It is true that the gradual but significant expansion in the scope, range and volume of the work of the United Nations has been a function of changing international circumstances and new challenges that have confronted the Organization. Nevertheless, there can be no denying the fact that the United Nations could be more cost effective and efficient.
-The necessary processes of reform and change have already begun. The Group of High-Level Intergovernmental Experts set up to review the efficiency of the financial and administrative functioning of the United Nations has already submitted its report. Since that report will be presented to the Assembly later on, under the appropriate agenda item, I shall refrain from commenting on it now. Suffice it to say that the Nigerian delegation attaches the greatest importance to the recommendations contained in that report. We believe that they provide a basis for revitalizing the IT of Nations and creating an organization better able to respond creditably and effectively to the collective needs of Member States, at reasonable and affordable cost.
In any process of reform, difficult choices have to be made. New priorities will have to be set. Cost-saving measures must be instituted. Indeed, readjustments in assessed contributions may even become necessary. However, such measures should not be dictated or imposed by any Member State or group of States. Instead, they should derive from negotiated agreement among all Member States. To do this successfully, we will all have to be tolerant and to appreciate each other's legitimate interests and concerns. Let us move away from apportioning blame and accept that the United Nations can only function on the basis of a consensus that adequately respects the concerns of each and all.
Thus, as a sign of good faith, those countries that have resorted to financial withholding as a means of registering their disapproval of the United Nations budget and programs should proceed to honor their obligations. The point has been made that the Organization is in need of reform, and the first steps towards that process of reform have already been taken. Those reforms should not be taken under duress.
Surely, a United Nations that grinds to a halt as the result of financial constraints cannot even engage in reform. One thing we all agree upon is that the United Nations is worth preserving. If it were not, we would not all be present here. A testament to the continued validity of the United Nations lies in the fact that the very countries that have been most vocal in calling attention to its shortcomings continue to exploit the forum it offers to address the world community on major issues of concern to them. Clearly, it is better to talk at the United Nations than to fight on the battlefield.
In addition, it is the view of the Nigerian delegation that the necessary reforms should be carried out in full accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter. The principle of sovereign equality of all Member States should not be derogated directly or indirectly, and essential programs and activities of high priority should continue to attract the lion's share of available resources. In other words, we must ensure that we do not end up cutting the bone while we trim the fat.
The present international situation is characterized by growing tension in both the political and the economic spheres. Confrontation, conflict and instability plague many regions of the world, and the economies of many Member States continue to deteriorate, while the politics of domination and great-Power rivalries are on the increase. In that situation, the role of the Organization has more than ever before, become vital for the promotion of international peace, development and prosperity for all.
All too often, we tend to forget that the Charter of the United Nations devotes two Chapters to the question of international economic and social co-operation. Indeed, in Article 55, the United Nations pledges itself to the promotion of 'higher standards of living, full employment' and 'solutions of international economic, social, health, and related problems', 'with a view to the creation of the conditions of stability and well-being necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations'. Therefore, if the inequities in the world economic system have persisted for so long, the fault is not with the Charter. Rather, it derives from the lack of political will by Member States to discharge their obligations.
Within the framework of the current global economic crisis, the widening gap between developed and developing countries and the persistence of an unjust and inequitable international economic system constitute major impediments to the development process of most Member States, thus posing a serious threat to international peace and security.
For their part, the industrialized countries have refused to address the problems of structural imbalance and inequality that characterize the international economic and trading system. Those imbalances have continued to prolong the severe set-backs afflicting our economic goals and objectives.
It is clear that we must once again consider seriously the problem of structural imbalance and inequality with a view to formulating concrete and
effective solutions to the question of the huge external debt of developing countries, the problems of debt-servicing, high interest rates, inflation, declining commodity prices, stiff conditions set by the International Monetary Fund, and protectionist measures and unfair trade terms continually imposed by the developed countries.
Commodity trade is currently the primary source of foreign-exchange earnings for a majority of developing countries. It is regrettable that specific measures to control commodity trade to the advantage of the developed market-economy countries should be embarked upon without sympathy or consideration for the repercussions on the current balance-of-payments position of developing countries.
Commodity prices are currently fluctuating and are therefore unstable. There is a continuous decline in capital resource flows as the result of lower export earnings, and this is a great hindrance to reinvestment in commodities. Financing through the facilities of the Common Fund for commodities has not materialized owing to the refusal by some major countries to ratify the instrument. This state of affairs has created complex cash-flow problems, which have further aggravated the debt problem. The high hopes of the developing countries for a new international economic order have foundered owing to a deeply rooted reluctance on the part of the developed countries to engage in an honest and Meaningful North-South dialog. My delegation wishes to stress the need for a fundamental structural readjustment in the international economic system that would promote rapid and sustained world economic growth and development. In this context, we reaffirm our commitment to the continued validity and relevance of the Declaration and program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order.
while developed countries have emerged from recession, the economic outlook for the developing nations in general, and Africa in particular, remains bleak. Attempts were made to draw the world's attention to Africa's special situation during last May's special session of the General Assembly on the critical economic situation in Africa. That special session succeeded at least in deepening global awareness of the dimensions of the current economic crisis in Africa. Given good intentions and strong will, that endeavor could well provide a basis for concerted efforts by the international community to enhance and support the tremendous efforts of African States to surmount their devastating crisis.
My delegation therefore appeals to the international community and to financial institutions to make available without delay sufficient resources for the full and effective implementation of the United Nations program of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development, 1986-1990. We do not, of course, ignore or lose sight of the need for developing countries themselves to co-operate effectively in improving their economic conditions. To that end a greater degree of collaboration on economic projects has to be developed. We are happy to note the activities of the Group of 77, in particular at the last meeting of the Group's Intergovernmental Follow-up and Co-ordination Committee (IFCC), which took place at Cairo and which focused attention on vital areas of high priority in co-operation among developing countries that needed greater emphasis. Similarly, we are gratified that the eighth summit meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement, which took place earlier this month at Harare, devoted considerable attention to economic co-operation.
An important and appropriate backdrop to our debate at this session is the declaration of 1986 as the International Year of Peace. As demanded in the solemn declaration. Member States of the United Nations have been focusing attention throughout the year on the requirements for the promotion of international peace and security. We in Nigeria have organized, at both the governmental and the non-governmental levels, various programs aimed at sensitizing the Nigerian people to the elements of genuine peace and to the role of the individual, of the State, of non-governmental organizations and of the United Nations in the promotion of peace. On 16 September, International Peace Day, Nigeria joined several other countries, when President Ibrahim Babangida personally launched the first Earth Run, the global torch relay which originated on the steps of the Headquarters of our Organization.
Unfortunately, peace remains elusive in many parts of the world. The situation in southern Africa, for instance, continues to be a source of concern to this Organization. In the past two years the world has witnessed the most aggressive phase of Pretoria's policies of mindless oppression and intimidation of the blacks, who have been subjected to the persistent and systematic violation of their fundamental human rights. Apartheid has meant violence and terror for the struggling people of South Africa. The apartheid regime is still undeterred in its implementation of policies which are repressive and are offensive to the laws of natural justice. Indeed, apartheid is a crime against humanity and against the ignity and conscience of mankind, and it continues to pose a threat to international peace and security. There can be no peace and stability in southern Africa without the elimination of apartheid, which is the root cause of the grave crisis in the entire region.
Since, in the wake of the Sharpeville massacres, the world was rudely awakened to the brutality and horrors of apartheid, there has been unanimous and repeated condemnation of that evil system. The crushing weight of apartheid has grown to the point where it has forced all segments of the oppressed to rebel in a spontaneous manner. The Soweto uprising demonstrated the fact that despite all the brutal machinery sustaining apartheid the black people of South Africa have had enough and cannot suffer in silence any more. Thousands of blacks, including mourners, have been gunned down by trigger-happy racist police; many more have been wounded or have suffered untold hardship. The response of the racist clique in Pretoria has been to resort to panic measures and to the declaration of a state of emergency, with a total clamp-down on news reports.
This notwithstanding, workers have initiated strike actions, and an ever-growing number of school children, working independently, have periodically boycotted classes to show their revulsion at the political powerlessness, economic deprivation, inferior education and dehumanizing segregation laws imposed on them by the racist regime. The countdown to the collapse of apartheid has at last started. As the cycle of violence and brutal repression grows in scale and intensity, the blacks have now resolved to make the supreme sacrifice.
The racist regime, instead of moving towards open negotiations with black leaders and reconciling anxious whites to inescapable change, persists in pretending that South Africa's problems at home and its already painful economic losses abroad can be chased away with a night-stick. Clearly, the apartheid regime
has shown that it is no mood to seek in peace the establishment of a democratic society in South Africa built on the equality of all races.
The fight against apartheid and racism is one facet of the liberation struggle in Africa. Another facet is the struggle for the liberation of Namibia, where the situation is equally explosive. The racist Pretoria rSgime persists in its illegal occupation of the Territory by ruthlessly suppressing the legitimate aspiration of the Namibian people to self-determination and independence. In spite of United Nations resolutions, culminating in Security Council resolution 435 (1978), which established modalities by which the people of Namibia would determine their future through free and fair elections, the racist regime has continued its policies of dehumanizing and brutalizing the overwhelming majority of Namibians.
Contacts between the Secretary-General and the apartheid regime aimed at finding an honorable way for the withdrawal of the South African administration have been frustrated through devious machinations by the racist regime. In fact, the posture of the regime constitutes a total rebuff of any meaningful discussion. The sad position now is that the illegal regime has gone ahead with the implementation of its so-called homelands policy aimed at destroying the unity and territorial integrity of Namibia.
My delegation recognizes that peace cannot be achieved in southern Africa in an environment characterized by criminal acts of aggression, racial discrimination and the systematic violation of human rights. The apartheid regime in South Africa is still undeterred in its implementation of policies that are repressive and offensive to human dignity. The international community, if it is not to be accused of complicity or impotence, must assume a more decisive role in the liquidation of the abhorrent and totally despicable system of apartheid. We must without fail put an end to it. Indeed, if a bloodbath of unspeakable proportions is to be avoided the international community will have to exert such pressure as will make the apartheid regime abandon its criminal policy. Surely, comprehensive mandatory sanctions applied faithfully by all Member States offer the last hope for a peaceful solution.
Happily, there is now much international enthusiasm for the campaign against apartheid. A vast majority of States, such as the members of the Non-Aligned Movement, the socialist States, the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the Nordic States and a few Western countries, have taken steps to combat apartheid. The United States Congress too has joined in this great movement to guarantee to the South African black people, 23 million of them, the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
Apartheid is not an internal affair of South Africa, but a universal affair. Witness the amount of time, energy and resources the international community devotes to it. Legitimately, therefore, this Assembly can and should miss no opportunity to advance the universal effort to achieve the peaceful dismantling of apartheid.
In that context, I propose that you, Mr. President, address on our behalf an urgent appeal, today, to the President of the United States to endorse the congressional action on sanctions against South Africa.
As for Nigeria, our commitment to the anti-apartheid struggle is total. We shall continue to give support to the liberation movements and assistance to the front-line States.
The question has often been raised in recent times whether we, either as Africans or as members of the international community, shall be prepared to offer the white community in South Africa an opportunity to be part of the process of change in South Africa. The answer is that we have always been prepared to accept the white community and its representatives as constituents in the process of change, provided change is the objective.
The Lusaka Declaration, first adopted by the Organization of African Unity and then by the United Nations, still represents our position. If the South African Government is prepared to talk about an effective program for the dismantlement of apartheid, we shall be prepared to facilitate the implementation of such a program.
The challenge, then, to South Africa and the opponents of mandatory economic sanctions is to get the South African regime to present a concise, detailed and specific program for the total eradication of apartheid.
The efforts of the international community for a peaceful settlement of the Middle East conflict have been frustrated by repeated acts of aggression and terrorism in that region. The solution to the Middle East question does not lie in the force of arms, which, rather than ameliorating the explosive situation, has further complicated the task of achieving peace. A comprehensive and just solution to the problems of the Middle East cannot be achieved unless there is a cessation of hostilities by all the parties concerned. Similarly, the present volatile situation cannot subside in the wake of territorial ambitions.
An issue that is central to the Middle East debacle is the problem of a homeland for the Palestinians. A realistic analysis of the reasons for the failures of past peace efforts reveal the non-acceptance of the Palestinian question as the principal problem for which there should be a genuine solution. No solution to the Middle East problem which does not take into account the plight of the Palestinians can be expected to guarantee durable peace in that region. The countries in the Middle East and the international community as a whole have to be sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, particularly the Palestinians' quest for a homeland. However, that is not to deny the right of Israel to existence as a State.
My delegation supports the holding of an international peace conference on the Middle East where all those involved would participate. There can be no justification for holding a conference with the primary responsibility of solving the problems of people who are not allowed to participate in it. The Palestinians should be involved in the peace process in the Middle East.
The resumption of bilateral arms negotiations by the two super-Powers early in 1985 gave the world some hope of improved political relations between the East and the West. That hope was further increased when on 1 January 1986 the leaders of the two world Powers exchanged new year messages. It is sad that what seemed to be
an improved political understanding between the East and the West has not been translated into action in the ongoing disarmament negotiations, while the world community was expecting genuine disarmament efforts, there was a resumption of nuclear tests, and this had negative implications for the moratorium on nuclear-weapon testing.
Nuclear weapons constitute a threat not only to peace and international security, but also to the survival of mankind. The elimination of nuclear weapons should be a vital disarmament objective of the world community, irrespective of ideological beliefs. The two super-Powers should give the lead in nuclear disarmament. A most desirable starting-point would be an agreement on a nuclear test ban, a measure which the international community has advocated for the past 25 years. We believe that no technical reason, such as the issue of verification, offers a genuine excuse for the delay in concluding a nuclear-test-ban treaty. What is lacking is the will on the part of nuclear-weapon States. In addition to the basic step of a nuclear test ban, we call for the commencement of real and decisive measures through bilateral and multilateral negotiations that will substantially reduce and ultimately eliminate the existing stockpile of nuclear weapons. Needless to say, the extension of the nuclear arms race to outer space is inconsistent with the fervent wish of the international community for nuclear disarmament. Disarmament is a global cause, in which all States have a vital stake. It cannot, and should not, be left to the vagaries of the relationship between the super-Powers.
Our Organization has an important role to play in keeping up the pressure to bring about a halt to the arms race, with the ultimate aim of achieving general and complete disarmament, under effective international control. In this regard my Government urges both the Soviet Union and the United States not to interrupt the
process of consultation and negotiation with the ultimate objective of eliminating nuclear weapons from the face of the earth.
There are other problems facing the international community that require our urgent attention. The Iran-Iraq war, the crisis in Central America and the issues of Afghanistan, Kampuchea, Cyprus and Korea all challenge our collective commitment to work for the promotion of the peaceful settlement of issues. I have highlighted only some of the major problems confronting us I believe we shall work together to solve these as well as the other problems.
The United Nations serves as a unique forum for the promotion of understanding and peace among all nations. It also provides a unique opportunity for Member States to engage in constructive dialog and co-operation in our common quest for a better world. We must, therefore, strive to work together to uphold the principles of the Charter in the interests of mankind.








1987

On behalf of the Nigerian delegation, I should like to offer our congratulations, Sir, on your unanimous and well-deserved election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. My delegation joins previous speakers in expressing our sentiments on your distinguished personal merits, which have eminently qualified you for this high office. I have no doubt that under your able leadership this session will achieve great success. I therefore have great pleasure in pledging to you the full support and co-operation of my delegation in the performance of your onerous task. 
We approach the work of the current session of this Assembly with a sense of objective realism. The original aims and objectives of the Charter hold even more true today in the quest for a peaceful world order and an enhanced process of economic development. It falls to the present members of this world Assembly to ensure the realization of those lofty ideals. The Charter, as applied from the inception of this Organization and strengthened by decisions and resolutions that reflect a preponderance of shared views and aspirations, remains sufficiently flexible to make possible the current effort to reform the structure of the United Nations system.
The reform measures put in place by the Secretary-General reflect a determined attempt to implement General Assembly resolution 41/213. This is admittedly a daunting task which we once again insist must remain faithful to the main purposes and objectives towards which the united Nations has directed its efforts for so many years. The world can ill afford to strip this Organization of its effectiveness and the universalist principles that have lent themselves to the aspirations of all member States, big and small, rich and poor. The need to reduce staff and costs must never obscure the need for the efficacy of collaborative efforts which the Organization has come to represent. 
The Organization must remain committed to the rigorous pursuit of such laudable ventures as are exemplified by resolution S-13/2, adopted at the thirteenth special session of the General Assembly to assist African economic recovery and development. It is our strong belief that nothing should detract from this Organization's resolve to maintain this programme on a priority list of issues which deserves a higher allocation of resources.
My delegation will support the ongoing process of reform provided it is geared to efficiency without any decrease in the adequate allocation of resources, be they human, financial or material. Unfortunately, however,  every  attempt at restructuring the Secretariat that occurred earlier this year is certain to undermine the wide-ranging support originally pledged to that process by member States. The Secretary-General must now focus his attention solely on a reorganization that ensures administrative efficiency. More important, it must be carried out with full cognisance of the tenets of the United Nations Charter regarding the sovereign equality of all member states.
In order to facilitate a smooth reordering of priorities and invigoration of a worth-while institutional framework geared to the achievement of development, the world needs peace. It deserves peace. yet this ideal situation continues to elude us. The African continent, which has most of the world's least developed countries, is unfortunately, plagued by intractable conflicts. Most of these conflicts can be traced to the nefarious activities of the racist minority regime in apartheid South Africa.
My Government has consistently drawn the attention of the international community to the plight of millions of indigenous inhabitants of South Africa. We have collaborated with an ever-widening cycle of concerned nations, which continue to urge those countries whose actions and pronouncements tend to embolden the apartheid regime in its open defiance of world opinion, to be mindful of the enormity of the negative stand they have taken.
More than ever before, the need for the international community to take concrete and effective measures towards the eradication of apartheid, which has been roundly condemned as a crime against humanity, cannot be over-emphasized.
The apartheid regime has torn families apart and destroyed humble places of abode of its largely impoverished African population. It has set Soweto ablaze, brutalized teenage Africans through torture and imprisonment. It dehumanised the indigenous population by relegating it to a state of statelessness. Today, over 100 laws are in place to stifle all shades of opinion, in particular, the media.
Friends of the apartheid regime have, in the past few years, delighted themselves with cosmetic measures, which the racists played up to the world as reforms, while its friends extolled these empty gestures, we have never relented in our steadfast opposition to this palliative political posturing. For, there can be no real peace in South Africa until the whole ignoble edifice of apartheid is completely dismantled.
Yet we cannot deny that in the past few years the majority of ordinary citizens, private organizations, educational institutions, religious and other well-meaning organizations in many countries have demonstrated their abhorrence of this unjust rule either by pulling their investments out of South Africa, or by vigorously urging their Governments to apply economic sanctions against the racists. We watch with deep interest and satisfaction the very mature approach of students, businessmen and trade unions in taking concrete action which underlines their commitment to political freedom and economic emancipation for the majority of South Africans. Regrettably, however, certain powerful individuals in high government positions remain unmoved. But the wind of change unleashed in the streets of Sharpeville, and strengthened in the classrooms of Soweto, has become a hurricane, which, as it gathers force, will no doubt sweep away all vestiges of repression and the unjust laws of the apartheid regime.
The process of shaping international opinion towards decisive action has been long and at times frustrating. But the present situation augurs well for 23 million Africans in South Africa. The positive roles of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the Nordic countries, the socialist States and a few Western countries are noteworthy. The groundswell of the anti-apartheid movement in the United States has now assumed such proportions that the Congress has unequivocally demonstrated its desire for positive change in the apartheid enclave. Apartheid is no longer perceived along partisan, ideological or racial lines.
The policy of Nigeria with regard to South Africa is clearly one of honour, but it is also one that holds firmly to the basic principles of the United Nations Charter, we have always stated that our belief in the armed struggle in South Africa and Namibia is predicated on the necessity to wrest, from an unjust order, those basic freedoms that many nations have always fought for in Europe and America. In this regard we also support a dialogue, conducted on the basis of true racial equality, to resolve the issue of the total eradication of apartheid. Let the racists talk to the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) with a view to bringing to an end the violence they started, and this Organization can then squarely face other major issues which still promote division in international relations.
The United Nations' failure, so far, to resolve the issue of Namibia's independence is inextricably intertwined with all the problems that call for early resolution in southern Africa. Racism and racial discrimination have always characterized Namibia's subjugation by South Africa. When in 1978 the Security Council agreed on a plan for the independence of Namibia, the world thought that the end of the indigenous population's nightmare was in sight. However, at the prompting of its Western friends, purely extraneous issues were introduced to ensure the denial of freedom to the Namibian people. Nigeria firmly repudiates the infamous linkage concept. We also reject any makeshift political devices that exclude recognition of the South West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO) as the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people. The encouragement of break-away factions only serves the purposes of apartheid South Africa, and the economic exploitation of the unholy alliance in that territory. The United Nations Council for Namibia must be strengthened to enable it effectively to administer the territory until the plan envisaged under Security Council resolution 435 (1978) has been fully implemented.
Last year, the General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring the South Atlantic a zone of peace and co-operation. This was and still remains, in Nigeria's view, a laudable gesture. It is my delegation's belief that the nations contiguous to the South Atlantic remain under an obligation to keep this zone free of super-Power rivalry, thus maintaining its innocent nature.
My country is eager to co-operate with any neighbouring country in any endeavour to achieve this objective. We are prepared to co-operate with all nations bordering the South Atlantic in efforts to guarantee freedom of navigation weather-forecasting and all plans favourable to environmental protection thereby ensuring that the interests of all humanity are adequately protected. To our South American friends we offer the vision of the South Atlantic Ocean as an ocean that unites rather than separates us.
The situation that exists between Chad and Libya is, to say the least, unfortunate and highly regrettable. The Organization of African Unity has mediated and continues to seek a peaceful solution to the problem. It is essential therefore that we should all give full support to the cause of peace that is being promoted by the OAU in this matter· We are therefore happy that the General Assembly deferred the inclusion of this matter in its agenda in order to give more time for further consultation.
An opportunity for such consultation took place at the summit level on 24 September 1987, in Lusaka, Zambia. It re-established a climate of dialogue which, we believe, will enhance the process of peaceful resolution of the conflict. In fact, the two parties to the conflict have reaffirmed their commitment and willingness to work towards a negotiated settlement of the dispute. In addition, they have accepted the OAU framework for its resolution.
In this regard the OAU Ad Hoc Committee on the dispute underlined the need o find a peaceful, African solution to it and warned against its internationalisation. We, therefore, call on the Assembly and the international community to respect Africa's wishes. We call for respect for the OAU peace efforts with regard to the conflict so that there may be a rapid return of peace to the area so that resources may be devoted to the process of development.
My delegation does not believe that the situation in the Middle East is beyond resolution. The fact is that in the absence of the political will to accord to the Palestinians the right to their own homeland, one of the main actors would have been pushed into the background. The main issues in a possible negotiation process would have been ignored. Just as Nigeria would reiterate the right of Israel to exist, my delegation is convinced that the role of peace would be served if all concerned also believed in peaceful coexistence. To this end, my delegation fully supports the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East, where all the main actors in the protracted dispute would be represented. We do not share the view that the peace process would be served by a denial of the right of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to be represented at such a conference. When, on 20 July 1987, the Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution which called for the cessation of hostilities between Iraq and Iran, the world heaved a sigh of relief. To render Security Council resolution 598 (1987) effective, we call on all those countries whose naval power is currently being flaunted in the Gulf to withdraw. There is no excuse for calling for the cessation of hostilities on the one hand, only shortly after to proceed with amassing an array of sophisticated naval fire-power that can only make it more difficult to achieve peace. It is doubly disappointing that both Iraq and Iran, two friends of Nigeria of long standing, have not yet achieved the peace they need for socio-economic development.
In like manner, the people of Afghanistan deserve peace. To this end, we commend the continuing efforts of the Secretary-General's Special Representative to achieve national reconciliation.
My delegation believes that the time has come to enable the people of Kampuchea to embark on reconstruction and development after such a protracted period of conflict and instability. The chronicle of unfortunate events in a friendly country, a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, is of great concern to my delegation. We urge all sides in this dispute to demonstrate their respect for the territorial integrity and non-aligned status of Kampuchea by implementing the relevant General Assembly resolutions to this effect.
Since 1985 the world has been given reason to believe that the end of the arms race is 9 little closer. The announcement by the super-Powers that a new round of disarmament talks in Geneva would tackle the reduction of nuclear arms, leading to their eventual elimination, was hailed by my Government as a step in the right direction. My delegation welcomes the 18 September announcement that the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have agreed in principle to a treaty to eliminate medium- and short-range missiles. We continue to urge all the nuclear States to devote greater energies to the total elimination of all weapons of mass destruction.
For 26 years the United Nations has urged that a test-ban treaty should be signed by nuclear-power States. A moratorium on testing would therefore seem a very logical approach. Accordingly, my delegation commended the Soviet union for its bold initiative last year unilaterally to impose a moratorium on weapons testing. Unfortunately, that commendable initiative has been brought to an end. It is even more regrettable that others were unable to reciprocate, thus making the search for a nuclear-weapon-free world that much more difficult.
There is a clear complementarily between disarmament, development and security. For instance, world military expenditure is currently estimated at $1 trillion, while the combined debt burden of all the developing countries is about the same amount. My delegation firmly supports any move to set aside some of this huge expenditure on armaments for development purposes. Care must be taken not to allow an otherwise praiseworthy idea to become entangled in ideological pretension.
The recently concluded Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development failed to achieve its main objective. Although it agreed on basic definitions, extraneous ideas were adopted which tended to elevate the abstract 'essence of armed security above that of trade and development. The failure to adopt any categorical plan for the release through financing arrangements of resources that it is hoped would be saved by disarmament may render further progress difficult. The current world economic situation, particularly for developing countries, leaves much to be desired. While substantial growth has continued in developed countries for the	consecutive year, the economic prospects for developing countries in general, and those of Africa in particular, continue to remain very bleak: Despite the painstaking efforts of most of the developing countries to undertake some appreciable levels of structural adjustment they continue to be haunted by monetary debt problems, insurmountable debt service problems falling commodity prices, unjustified protectionism in some developed countries against developing countries' commodities, and high interest rates.
It will be recalled that in May 1986 a special session of the General Assembly was Held which resulted in the adoption of a United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990, to be implemented at the national, regional and international levels· In spite of the national measures taken by African countries in the form of structural adjustment, and at the international level in support of the United Nations Programme by way of the $12.4 billion replenishment of the International Development Association, 45 per cent of which is to be allocated to sub-Saharan Africa  it is still unlikely that an adequate financial flow will be provided to bridge the financing gap which Africa is expected to face until 1990 and beyond.
The Conference sponsored by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa and devoted exclusively to the challenge of economic recovery and accelerated development in Africa met in Abuja, Nigeria, from 15 to 19 June this year. It recommended a comprehensive approach to aid flows to support structural adjustment programmes in Africa and focused particularly on disbursing funds for spare parts and material needed to increase the utilization of existing capacity in industry, agriculture and public infrastructure. The Conference called for an exceptional measure to reduce the debt service burden of African countries, which should include measures to convert official development assistance debt into grants, longer repayment and grace periods, lower interest rates on existing official debt, and consideration of the possibility of repayment of debts in local currencies by African countries. I whole-heartedly commend these recommendations to the Assembly.
Our concern focuses on the fact that a lot is expected of us by way of sacrifice, but it seems that nothing is being realized in return for the sacrifices we have made and continue to make. In the recent past, certain proposals were made by some developed countries to alleviate Africa's crippling debt crisis. Unfortunately, the promises of the Baker plan, British proposals on rescheduling and low interest rate concessions to developing countries have not been fully implemented.
Despite these efforts, a lot more is still required to meet the expanding resource demands of developing countries, particularly when net private foreign investment has also fallen back substantially, from an estimated $17,2 billion at the peak in 1981 for all capital importing developing countries to $7.7 billion in 1985. Thus, the requirement that developing countries finance debt service from trade surpluses rather than from additional capital inflows remains untenable.
I have no doubt that when the Secretary-General reports to the Assembly on his efforts in dealing with the financial crisis of Africa, we shall be well briefed on the practical and politically acceptable proposals put forward by the expert group which he set up in April to deal with debt relief and financial flows to African countries. This Assembly and the international community in general can do a lot to support the Programme of Action and proposals that will provide Africa in particular and developing countries in general with the essential external resource input necessary for their development. The seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), which was held in Geneva in July and August of this year, provided the international community with a unique opportunity to negotiate an agreement on the interrelated issues of debt, resource flows, trade and development. That Conference gave recognition to the belief that any resolution of the debt Question must be within the context of the need to foster growth and development in the developing world. In Geneva, the international community agreed that while developing nations need to restructure their economies, there is a corresponding obligation on the developed nations to increase resource flows to third-world nations. The seventh session of UNCTAD agreed that since the collapse of commodity prices has accentuated the debt burden of developing nations there is urgent need for producers and consumers of raw materials to work together to strengthen commodity agreements, not only because of the need to restore commodity prices to remunerative and equitable levels, but also to revitalize co-operation between the developed and developing nations. The seventh session of UNCTAD reminded us all that multilateral co-operation is a catalyst for reviving the world economy as a whole.
It cannot be assumed that ideas, or even mechanisms, for furthering solutions to pressing issues concerning the world economy should be pursued only in the North-South context. On the contrary, developing countries not only are keenly aware of but have, through various mechanisms, given concrete expression to the need to exploit the potential for co-operation among themselves in the economic and technical fields. Nigeria, in close collaboration with its partners in the Economic Community of West African States, has taken steps to invigorate our sub region's capacity to achieve rapid economic recovery through trade liberalization and the pooling of resources. Yet all joint programmes, worked out with the active co-operation of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, as well as the Organization of African Unity (OAU), can achieve the desired goal only if the problems of debt, stabilization of exchange rates and greater access to the markets of the developed countries are resolved.
The 1972 United Nations Conference on the Environment, held in Stockholm, was an important milestone since it not only sensitised concern for but also helped to fashion a global consensus on issues of the environment. That Conference has generated in its wake a number of initiatives on the environment, culminating in the establishment of the World Commission on Environment and Development, which has issued a report entitled Our Common Future.
My Government welcomes that report. We take particular satisfaction in its basic message that there is a close connection between ecology and economy and a need to ensure that sustainable development does not impair the capacity of future generations to meet their own requirements.
We care very deeply about the issue of the environment, as is demonstrated by the measures we have instituted to safeguard our environment. None the less we are also keenly aware that major environmental problems are often global in character, and we therefore feel that it is unhelpful to ascribe lack of interest in environmental protection largely to developing countries when they are in fact often marginal to the causes of environmental problems.
Furthermore, my Government is of the view that we should guard against translating concern for environmental protection into a new form of conditionality for development assistance by the multilateral development and financial institutions, so that the cost of development will not unnecessarily be made even more burdensome for already overburdened developing countries.
The problems of drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking have reached alarming proportions. The United Nations sponsored international conference held in Vienna earlier this year was timely. Apart from the severe sanctions contained in Nigeria's domestic laws against drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking, Nigeria has, at the international level, signed bilateral agreements with some countries to deal with drug-related issues, especially illicit drug trafficking. Nigeria also has national laws and regulations in conformity with the United Nations conventions on psychoactive drugs. While Nigeria supports the idea of an international convention to deal with drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking, it must be stressed that global uniformity in sanctions against illicit drug trafficking is long overdue. It would certainly put a stop to the movement of drug traffickers from countries with severe sanctions to those with more lenient ones.
In conclusion I should like once again to stress my delegation's commitment to the principle of multilateralism in all spheres of activity of the Organization. The United Nations will not be able to achieve a positive role in world events if we stray from the aims and objectives of its Charter. We must therefore be prepared to do more than merely accuse the super-Powers of monopolizing responsibility for and initiatives on the resolution of conflicts.
It is our conviction that the time has come when we must all share the responsibility for conflict management through an active commitment to world peace. We must continuously seek to contribute to the basket of ideas that will facilitate such a process. The issue of peace is so critical that we cannot afford to abdicate that responsibility. 

Ours should be a world of peace; it should be a world of security, and above all it should be a world of justice, where we work together to uphold the principles and tenets of the Charter in order to attain our common future.
  




1988


On behalf of the Nigerian delegation. Sir, I wish to congratulate you on your election as President of the General Assembly at this session. I am particularly pleased to see you occupying this high office because of the very friendly relations between our two countries. I am sure that this session of the Assembly will benefit from the sterling qualities that you will undoubtedly bring to bear on your duties as President. May I assure you of my co-operation and support and that of Nigeria during your tenure of office.
This session is taking place at a time of considerable improvement in the international political climate. The United Nations has proved its value as an effective and indispensable instrument in the painstaking process of negotiating the terms of settlement of most regional problems. This augurs well for the future of the United Nations and of mankind. At this point, may X congratulate the Secretary-General on the leadership role he has played in the cause of world peace and the strengthening of the United Nations.
The award a few hours ago of the Nobel Peace Prize for 1988 to the United Nations peace-keeping forces is the greatest tribute that could be paid at this time to our Organization, but it is also a challenge to the United Nations to strive even harder to progress from peace-keeping to peace-making. As Chairman of the United Nations Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations, Nigeria is proud to be associated with the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations.
The international economic environment remains extremely unfavourable for the developing countries. The Indices of this situation include the continuing decline in the prices of primary commodities, the general worsening of the terms of trade, the problem of rising protectionism, the increasing debt burden and net capital outflow from these countries. The political will needed to address these issues, in particular the debt problem, has not been sufficiently demonstrated by the developed countries. Indeed, the debt burden has become a major impediment to our economic growth and social development. The North-South colloquy has lost momentum, and with it the desire to look critically at the operations of the international economic system.
Nowhere has this worsening economic situation facing the developing countries been exemplified more vividly than in Africa. The economic situation of the continent remains critical. In our determination to improve our economic situation, we have embarked on major reforms of our national economies. Many of us have courageously undertaken fundamental structural adjustments aimed at reviving our economies, stimulating growth and promoting development.
The reform measures have included drastic devaluation of our currencies, reduction or elimination of subsidies, privatisation of publicly owned enterprises and the streamlining of our bureaucracies. These measures entail considerable political risks, and social costs arising from the sacrifices which our peoples have been called upon to make. They certainly demonstrate our willingness to do everything possible towards the development of self-reliant economies.
The mid-term review and appraisal of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Recovery and Development 1986-1990 has demonstrated that the serious economic difficulties faced by African countries remain largely unsolved and in most cases have worsened. The contributions of the international community to the implementation of the Programme have fallen short of the expectations of African countries. Yet, when the Programme was adopted at the thirteenth special session of the General Assembly, two years ago, it was widely acclaimed as a positive response by the international community to the serious economic problems of the African continent.
Nigeria perceives the Programme as a compact between African countries and the international community. We in Africa are fulfilling our own side of the pact; we expect the international community to fulfil its commitment. Jointly, we must find solutions to the roost serious economic problems facing African countries through debt relief, an increase in official development assistance and support for agreements to stabilize the prices of primary commodities:, on which the economies of most African countries depend.
The Nigerian Government is facing the challenges of the overall development of our national economy with a courage and dedication unequalled in our history. The focus of the strategy is the modernization and transformation of our national economy. To this end we have adopted a structural adjustment programme designed to improve the performance of our economy. The implementation of this programme has opened up opportunities for our citizens and improved the climate for foreign investment in our country.
Two years of its implementation have brought into bold relief the obstacles that hamper our development. These include, principally, the lack of an adequate supply of external financing and the high cost of imported manufactured products and machinery. These problems have been made more acute by our crushing debt burden and debt-service obligations, as well as by huge losses in export earnings as a result of the sharp and continuing decline in the prices of our primary commodities, including oil. Thus the economic development of Nigeria, like that of most other developing countries, continues to be constrained by an adverse international economic environment. 
We believe that the economic problems of African and other developing countries are issues that can no longer be swept under the carpet. The phenomenon of a world in which one fifth of the population lives in luxury and affluence and four fifths live in abject poverty and squalor cannot guarantee peace and security for mankind. Such a world would have little chance of saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war, nor would it promote fundamental human rights and the dignity and worth of the human person.
We believe that, unless the international community takes more seriously its obligations and commitment to establish conditions in which justice and respect for human dignity prevail, the primary purpose of our Organization, which is the maintenance of international peace and security, will continue to be in jeopardy.
In a few weeks we shall be celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the adoption by the United Nations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Since its adoption the world has witnessed tremendous progress in the field of human rights, globally, regionally and nationally. The one exception to the universal advancement of the rights of the individual is South Africa, where a white minority continues to trample upon the rights of the black majority. When we in Africa discuss the issue of human dignity, we do so with the conviction that our African culture recognizes the sanctity of life and liberty as universal. We believe that when any man's dignity is trampled upon anywhere in the world, all mankind suffers a little. That is why we denounce apartheid as morally outrageous and indefensible and politically unacceptable to the civilized world. The pernicious apartheid system continues to be an affront to the international community. Worse still, the racist regime continues to destabilize the front-line States of southern Africa.
It is not only unfortunate but out rightly unacceptable that this evil regime in Pretoria should continue to pursue its obnoxious policies with the active support of important Members of this world Organization. Though we are told with sanctimonious piety that sanctions do not work, the same countries that make the claim are quick to impose sanctions on other States with which they disagree. We call on all Member States to rise above pecuniary considerations and impose comprehensive and mandatory sanctions on that evil regime.
The Commonwealth Committee of Foreign Ministers on southern Africa, of which Nigeria is a member, has produced incontrovertible evidence to attest that sanctions indeed do work. I know that South Africa has been feeling the effect of the limited sanctions imposed on it by some Members of the United Nations. We ate most disheartened to know not only that a number of countries are continuing unashamedly to trade with South Africa while proclaiming their abhorrence of the evil system of apartheid, but that some of them are benefiting from the limited sanctions imposed on that State. This must stop.
We call on all those who give the racists succour and support to join the civilized world in ostracizing that pariah State until a non-racial regime comes to power in South Africa. Nigeria will continue to support progressive forces within and outside South Africa that are committed to the dismantling of apartheid. This is a commitment that is shared by our people and our Government. Nigerians see the denial of basic human rights to black people in South Africa as a slut on mankind. That is why as far back as 1976, for example, individual Nigerians voluntarily contributed 315 million to support the peoples of southern Africa in their just struggle to be free.
Africans ate a generous and forgiving people. When right triumphs over wrong in South Africa, when freedom overcomes tyranny, when harmony replaces discord and dissension, the Boers will not be victims of reverse racism, as many of them fear rather they, along with all God's children on the African continent, will march forward in freedom and harmony for the good of the human race. This is the thrust of the Lusaka Manifesto adopted by the Organization of African Unity in 1969.
We call on this Assembly to convene a special session in 1989 devoted to apartheid in South Africa and the destructive consequences of South African aggression against the front-line and neighbouring countries. We hope that the special session will formulate new strategies for the early liquidation of the apartheid system.
We welcome the ongoing negotiations on Angola and Namibia. We believe Angola should be left to develop along its chosen line. It is also the sovereign prerogative of Angola to secure its independence. The recent withdrawal of South African forces from Angola is only a return to sanity, legality and international decorum. Ten years ago the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 435 (1978). The continued illegal occupation of Namibia constitutes not only an affront to the United Nations but a deliberate challenge to the Security Council. South Africa must withdraw forthwith from Namibia. 
It is to us an irony of our times that any group of countries, fully aware of the grave dangers posed to lives and the environment, would either condone the dumping of toxic and radioactive waste or actively encourage their export to other countries. The international community must accept, as my Government has actively canvassed, that dumping of toxic and radioactive waste is a moral equivalent of war.
The Nigerian Government has made its position clear on this matter, and followed this up with a call on the international community, at the subregional and regional levels, to enact laws to discourage this callous and unacceptable assault on lives and the environment.
At the levels of the Organization of African Unity and the Economic Community of West African States, firm resolutions have been adopted to discourage the importation of these hazardous wastes into our continent and to penalize any persons or private organizations which collaborate with outside interests to turn Africa into the garbage dump for toxic and radioactive waste. At the meeting in July, in Rio de Janeiro, of the countries of the South Atlantic, bold new steps were taken to strike back at this menace before it becomes truly unmanageable.
Recently also, the Nicosia meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Non-Aligned Movement adopted a Declaration which strongly condemned the dumping of hazardous waste. With the establishment of a 'Dump watch', my country is currently collaborating with many Members of this Organization in the dissemination of precise information on the extent and location of toxic waste vessels now roaming the high seas. We have co-operated with and will continue to count on the excellent support of non-governmental organizations which have devoted their time and other resources to the protection of the environment. 
Nigeria was a victim of this despicable practice. Between August 1987 and May 1988, toxic wastes were secretly dumped in the Koko Port area of my country. By this act, the people and the environment of Koko were put at very grave risk. In addition, the economic life of the area was dislocated. The Nigerian Government moved with despatch to have the waste removed. It also enacted appropriate national legislation against the dumping of toxic and radioactive waste. 
My delegation is gratified to note that several delegations have in the course of this debate and in other forums condemned this act and expressed their willingness to crusade effectively against it. As a starting point, we have called on all Member States to curb the activities of those involved in the Tran boundary movement of waste. We call also on all Member States and non-governmental organizations to adopt the 'Dump Watch'.
Just as we are worried about the dangerous effects of toxic and radioactive wastes on the environment, we are also concerned about the possible hostile use of these wastes. We are equally happy that the International Atomic Energy Agency at its thirty-second session, last month, condemned all practices of nuclear-waste dumping and requested the Director General to establish a working group of experts to draw up a code for international transactions involving nuclear wa3te. We call upon the present session of the General Assembly to give the Conference on Disarmament the mandate of commencing negotiations on a draft convention on the prohibition of the dumping of radioactive and toxic waste for hostile purposes.
In the Middle East, after four decades of endemic cycles of violence and needless loss of life, the United Nations has finally outlined a peace process which, if faithfully implemented, has a credible chance of bringing durable peace to that area. Nigeria supports a United Nations-sponsored international conference on the Middle East.
Another area where a solution compatible with the Charter of the Organization is urgent is Kampuchea. Nigeria will continue to work within the United Nations, particularly through the Committee on Kampuchea, in pursuit of an acceptable solution to this problem. The ongoing withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan has demonstrated what is possible when there is political will. It is our hope that the Geneva accords on Afghanistan will be adhered to by all the parties concerned.
Similarly, we commend the peace initiatives of the Latin American and Central American countries. We call- on the entire international community to support the ongoing process for a lasting peace in Central America.
I had the opportunity at the fifteenth special session of the General Assembly, devoted to disarmament, to congratulate the two super-Powers on the conclusion and ratification of the Treaty on intermediate-range nuclear forces. That agreement is historic as the first true nuclear disarmament measure eliminating an entire category of nuclear weapons. The joint declaration by President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought has given great relief to a world dangerously threatened by the possibility of self-destruction.
My delegation, like others that worked hard for the successful outcome of the special session devoted to disarmament, is naturally disappointed at the failure to agree on a concluding document. However, we believe that the international community cannot afford to be totally discouraged by such periodic reverses. We appeal to the super-Powers to see multilateral involvement by the United Nations in disarmament as a useful and necessary complement to bilateral and regional efforts. An urgent area for multilateral action is the negotiation of a convention on chemical weapons.
The achievements of the Organization in the four decades of its existence have been quite impressive. The United Nations has contributed substantially to the decolonization process. But we should ensure that we respect and modernize the instruments and frameworks of, accountability such as the codes, conventions, norms and principles that at present regulate international relations. 
We are encouraged by the resurgence of hope and faith in our Organization. We are further encouraged by the increasing desire to use it for the primary purpose of advancing international peace and security.
The United Nations is indispensable to all the countries of the world. The presence of all of us here is a reaffirmation of that fact. My country, Nigeria, remains firmly committed to the United Nations Charter.



1989



It is with great pleasure that I congratulate you, a compatriot and comrade-in-arms, on your unanimous election as President of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-fourth session.
On behalf of my President, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, His Excellency General Ibrahim Badamasi Babanqida, and the Government and the people of Nigeria, I want to thank the Member States of this august Assembly for electing Major-General Joseph Nanven Garba, our Permanent Representative, as President. In particular, I wish to pay tribute to the African Group and to place on record the gratitude of my Government to the Governments of Cameroon and Egypt for facilitating the African consensus which led to your unanimous election. I also salute the Caribbean Group for its support. Your election to this esteemed office at this time is as much a recognition of Nigeria's role in international affairs as it is a tribute to your sterling qualities.
I also pay tribute to your predecessor in office, Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina, for the exemplary manner in which he guided the affairs of this Assembly during the forty-third session.
I should also like to take this opportunity to express the gratitude of my delegation to the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Perez de Cuellar, who has, once again, piloted our organization through the rough waters of international relations in the past year.
The tasks before you, Mr. President, are many and challenging. You have the responsibility of building upon the rich traditions and challenges associated with the conduct of the General Assembly. We are confident that under your guidance our organization will rekindle the hopes and aspirations of mankind for a peaceful world. We have witnessed significant changes in international relations in recent years. There is need for us, as the United Nations, to respond to this emerging situation in a manner that offers opportunities in resolving problems in the critical areas of international peace, security and development.
At no time in the recent past has there been greater hope for peace than now. Super-Power relations have become less frosty. There has been modest progress in disarmament negotiations. While tensions have not been completely eliminated, the serious threats of a major conflict have receded. This improvement in the international political climate must, however, be simultaneously accompanied by an equal emphasis on urgent and effective solutions to the non-military threats to the security of the developing countries. We must ensure that no section of the international community feels excluded from the benefits arising from the new spirit of international co-operation.
The African continent, where the general situation is deteriorating at an alarming rate, has that feeling of exclusion, and justifiably so. National economies have been gravely weakened, especially by the crippling debt burden, setting in reverse the living standards of our peoples. While we have made courageous structural adjustment sacrifices, the expected international support has either turned out to be a trickle or even non-ex is tent. The vital sectors of health, education and other social infrastructure have suffered immeasurably. The consequence of all this is the increasing impoverishment, marginalization and alienation of the African continent. We do not believe that this augurs well for international peace and security. It is a sombre situation that must not continue into the last decade of this century. The response to this challenge calls for a new imagination and resourcefulness, new approaches and a new resolve on the part of us all.
There continue to be a marked contrast between the sense of relative accomplishment and progress on international political questions and the lack of progress in international economic issues. While the economies of the industrialized countries have enjoyed unprecedented growth, the economies of developing countries, as a group, have continued to stagnate and decline. On the critical question of the external debt of developing countries, there has been some movement from preoccupation with short-term crisis management to the recognition of the need for reduction of the staggering debt stock and its servicing. As promising as the debt reduction process seen, we are concerned not only about the inadequate resources committed to it, but also that some Governments and commercial banks are hesitant to participate in it. Universal participation by the Governments of such industrialized countries and their commercial banks is essential if the benefits of debt reduction are to be spread to all indebted countries.
But today, substantial resources needed to promote growth and development have been used up to service debt. The debt crisis has been transformed into a growth crisis. In the heavily indebted countries, growth has faltered as have investment and per capita consumption. The appalling economic conditions of the indebted countries leave us in no doubt that there is need for strong international support for those countries. It was for these reasons that my President, General Ibrahim Babanqida, put forward at the ninth summit meeting of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, a number of important proposals regarding the debt question, which I now commend to the Assembly, as follows:
'(a) All official debts owed to creditor countries in bilateral transactions, should qualify for outright cancellation by the creditor countries involved. This proposal has been made to take account of the generalized poverty of developing countries which is manifested in the weak and persisting primary structures and mono-cultural nature of their economies;
Regarding debts owed to the Bretton Woods institutions, that is, the IMP and the World Bank, a few devices should be considered to bring relief to debt-distressed developing, particularly, sub-Saharan African, countries: (1) 50 per cent of the resources under the IDA-9th Replenishment should be made available to African countries. (2) Resources under the Structural Adjustment Fund (SAP) of the IMF, and the sub-Saharan African Facility of the World Bank, should be made available to countries with overdue debt service obligations to the two institutions. Repurchases can then be undertaken by the affected countries, with the advantage of enjoying the relief inherent in those facilities;
'(c) Regarding debts owed to commercial banks, an international debt purchasing institution or agency should be set up under the aegis of the IMF and the World Bank to purchase the existing debt of developing countries at substantial discounts of up to 80 per cent. The transactions could be financed partly with voluntary contributions from developed countries and also with uncommitted resources under the specialized facilities of the World Bank and the IMF with low or no conditionality attached.'
The economic situation in Africa is particularly grave. African countries remain highly vulnerable to adverse trends in weather and the international economic environment. They did not benefit from the price surge and expansion of world trade in 1988.
In general, African countries have faired badly in the 1980s. The cumulative trade deficit stood at $57 billion as of 1988. Africa's external debt rose from S128 billion in 1982 to .1230 billion in 1988, which is approximately 82 per cent of total regional gross domestic product and represents 314 per cent of exports of goods and services.
That Africa's economic situation has worsened at a time when many African countries have embarked on economic policy reforms, is evidence that policy reforms are, by themselves, no guarantee of growth and development, unless they are adequately financed. That the international economic environment continues to be harsh on the African countries is further proof that the commitments made by the international community to support Africa in the context of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development are far from being fulfilled.
I submit that both the premise and the practice of international co-operation for development would be most severely tested in Africa in the 1990s, as medium-term prospects for the continent appear less bright than in other regions. Sustained international support for the economies of African countries is most urgent if we are to resume growth and development. In this regard, Nigeria welcomes, as part of the solution to the problem, the recommendation of the Independent Group on Financial Flows to Developing Countries, the Schmidt Commission, that major surplus countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), should establish a 31 billion Endowment Fund to be administered by the African Development Bank (ADB) to provide debt relief measures and further increase official development assistance to the region.
The international community - particularly the industrialized nations among us - must utilize the opportunity afforded by the special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation in April 1990, to give fresh impetus to development co-operation.
The environmental degradation consequent upon modern technological and industrial developments has been causing great concern. Indeed, there are some who are already positing that environmental issues may well dominate the decade of the 1990s. However, the problem cannot be solved by shifting environmental degradation from one part of the world to other unsuspecting parts. Nor will a neglect of the requirements of one part, while concentrating on those of another, provide an effective global solution.
In this connection, the dumping of toxic wastes in developing countries, especially in Africa, constitutes a serious danger to the lives of our people and to the environment. My delegation calls on the international community to intensify its effort to prohibit this unwholesome practice. We urge the United Nations to adopt the Dump Watch for effective action against indiscriminate waste dumping.
On the subject of international efforts to clean up the environment, I should like to underline the need for a global vision that does not neglect the developing countries. International co-operation for preventing and countering the devastating effects of flooding, desertification, sudden weather changes, water pollution, to mention a few, can be as important in some countries as are measures aimed at the restoration of the ozone layer.
Countries are now being urged to pursue the path of environmentally sound and sustainable development. Adequate financial resources, as well as technical and technological assistance, need to be provided to the developing countries to enable them to reinforce their policies of environmental protection. It is equally important that policy prescriptions and measures for alleviating environmental degradation are not directed at developing countries alone, nor environmental criteria made a condition for extending the requisite assistance to them. It is recognized that there is a direct linkage between the prevention of environmental degradation and development in developing countries. We believe it is in the interest of the technologically advanced nations to invest in developing countries in the critical areas of water resources, erosion control, reforestation and alternative sources of energy, to mention just a few. That will assist in preserving the ecosystem world-wide.
In the field of human rights, Nigeria commends the continued and untiring efforts by all exponents of those basic rights and freedoms. As the international community this year celebrates the twentieth anniversary of the Declaration on Social Progress and Development (General Assembly resolution 2542 (XXIV)), Nigeria notes the work of the Committee which over the past decade has been working on the draft convention of the rights of the child, we hope that the proposed convention will be adopted by consensus.
The situation in southern Africa remains a source of serious concern. Racist South Africa persists in its aggression and policy of destabilization of its neighbours. The present situation in that country must be viewed with great circumspection. A new President elected under the apartheid system, which denies 28 million black people constituting more than 70 per cent of the population the right to vote, has been making statements intended to project the image of a reformer. It was only a few years ago that the former President of the apartheid regime announced, with a fanfare, impending reforms. The result was a constitutional sham that did not address the basic problem of the inhuman South African system. If this new apartheid President has begun his regime by speaking the language of peaceful change, we have every right to say to him: We have heard all this before; we are not impressed.  


Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia on 1 April 1989 - have been resolved. None the less we are concerned about the climate of intimidation and terror that still exists in Namibia, and especially about the activities of the Koevoet units, some of which have been absorbed into the regular police force. We demand their immediate removal. As a measure of our support of the transition process, Nigeria is contributing police personnel and electoral monitors as well as rendering financial and other assistance.
At this critical period we call on the international community to remain vigilant so as to ensure the integrity of the United Nations in the implementation of the Namibian independence plan. That is required in the face of calculated attempts by racist South Africa to manipulate the transition programme. We are particularly concerned about the inherent perfidy of the proclamations of the Electoral Constituent Assembly. 
We insist the elections be free and fair, as envisaged in the enabling Security Council resolutions. Until independence is achieved Namibia remains the responsibility of the Organization. The United Nations cannot afford to disappoint Africa and the world. For this last colony on the continent of Africa so much is at stake, not only for Namibia and Namibians but also for peace and stability in all of southern Africa.
An independent Namibia will require considerable assistance. It is in recognition of that fact that, even in these difficult times, Nigeria has rallied to the support of the brotherly people of Namibia. As a demonstration of our commitment to the cause of the freedom and independence of Namibia, Nigeria launched, on 16 June 1989, a Namibia Solidarity Fund of 100 million naira to assist the new State at independence. We urge the international community to rise to the challenge and render all possible assistance to the Namibian people.

On Cambodia and Central America, the international community must persist in the search for a durable peace. We support the ongoing initiatives for attaining this objective, including those undertaken within their respective regional frameworks.
By the same token, Nigeria supports the efforts towards peaceful unification on the Korean peninsula. It is noteworthy that in spite of their present circumstances the Korean people have, in various ways, made significant contributions to international understanding and co-operation. The international community will benefit even more from the admission of the Koreans into the United Nations and other international organizations of their choice.
Nigeria will continue to contribute significantly to reaching the objectives of general and complete disarmament under effective international control. The arms race threatens international peace and security and still constitutes an unacceptable diversion of resources which could better serve the cause of world-wide economic and social development. We therefore note with satisfaction the current bilateral negotiations between the super-Powers. This should lead to deep reductions and, subsequently, total elimination of nuclear and chemical weapons. However, the abiding general interest of our community demands that the multilateral disarmament machinery be involved in the process of negotiating disarmament agreements.
There was once an Africa strong and adventurous. That glorious past is adequately chronicled. Later Africa became the victim of actions to which the continent was not a party. That past also belongs to history. On the eve of the last decade of this century we in Africa are determined never again to be marginalized in any area of human endeavour. The international community should respond positively to Africa's yearnings for co-operation and development. We believe that on the basis of the principle of shared responsibility foe the destiny of our planet Africa can offer a credible partnership for a better and snore prosperous world.
The developed world must appreciate our common humanity and adopt policies that will eliminate the present yawning gap between the privileged and the underprivileged. It is our hope that through the instrumentality of the United Nations mankind's aspirations to fairness, justice and equity will be achieved. We look forward to an international system that eliminates the present reality, in which a large section of humanity is economically and politically under represented. For in a world of persistent inequity there is no guarantee for peace, stability and progress. It must be borne in mind that no one is secure until all are secure in an increasingly interdependent global village. However, there comes a time when a people, no matter how embattled, must take its future into its own hands. That journey must begin now. The African train is on the move: we must rebuild Africa.
Our vision is of an Africa whose dignity and independence will be reinforced by the birth of a free and sovereign Namibia-, an Africa free of the scourges of apartheid; an Africa that will direct its energies to the urgent development needs of its peoples-, an Africa that will uphold the rights and defend the interests of people of African descent wherever they may be-, an Africa that will have the courage, the will and the determination to summon the creative ingenuity and acknowledged resourcefulness of its people; an Africa that will make a major contribution to and use advances in science and technology to enhance its productive capacity and development. It is, above all, a vision of a self-confident Africa in which democracy and human rights will flourish.

 




1990
I congratulate you, Sir, on your unanimous election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session. Your election is testimony to the high esteem in which both you and your country, Malta, are held by the international community, we are confident that you will provide effective leadership to the work of the Assembly.
Let me also take this opportunity to pay tribute to ray compatriot, Major-General Joseph Garba, President of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. I congratulate him for a successful tenure and for bringing honour to our country. May I also thank the international community and, in particular, Africa for the support accorded Nigeria during the period we hold the presidency.
I commend the efforts and the contribution of the Secretary-General to the enhancement of the role of our Organisation.
Since the last session our Organisation has undergone positive changes in its membership. On behalf of the Government and the people of Nigeria, I wish again to welcome the Republic of Namibia to membership of the United Nations. In this connection, we commend the role played by the Organisation and the entire international community in the attainment of Namibia's independence. May I also welcome our newest Member, Liechtenstein. Similarly, we congratulate the Government and the people of Yemen for their reunification. 
In the same vein, we also look forward to the historic reunification of Germany. We expect that a united Germany will be accorded a significant role within the Organisation. We expect, through these changes, that the United Nations will reflect not only the new realities in world affairs, but will also embark on equitable geographical representation at the highest level of the Organisation. Indeed, the time has come for the United Nations to be restructured to give Africa a permanent seat in the Security Council. Other regions equally deserve consideration. This will give full expression to the universality of our Organisation.
Since the last session of our Assembly, new positive trends have emerged in the international political environment. There has been a new universal wave of democracy. The Berlin Hall has been pulled down. Even more important, in the immediate aftermath of the cold war, ideological rivalry has been replaced by increased super-Power co-operation, opening the way to the enhanced relevance of the United Nations in global affairs. We can only hope that these positive trends will provide the requisite climate to enable the developing countries to pursue their objective of development in freedom and peace.
Despite some positive treads, there are still unresolved questions which may put in jeopardy the emerging world order based on co-operation. The breach of peace and security in the Gulf, which we have all condemned, the threat of renewed conflict in the Middle East and the economic stagnation and decline in the developing countries, all point to the fact that our optimism should be guarded, and that security and survival remain the most important questions on the international political agenda.
The crisis in the Gulf constitutes the greatest threat to international peace and security today. Nigeria believes firmly in the non-use of force in international relations. It is for this reason that Nigeria commends the Security Council for all the measures it has adopted in dealing with the Iraqi invasion and annexation of Kuwait. Nigeria not only endorses all these measures, but has also taker, steps to implement appropriate Security Council resolutions. Nigeria once again calls on Iraq to pull out, unconditionally, all its forces from Kuwait. Kuwait is a sovereign nation. Consequently, its territorial integrity cannot and should not be compromised.
It is gratifying to see a vibrant and enhanced role for the United Nations in the emerging world order. We hope that this swift and collective response and action in the Gulf will be the norm in cases of tension for all time.
The experience of the developing countries in the 19308 has not borne out the notion that sustained growth in the industrialised North would serve as an engine of growth in the South. While the industrialised nations have had about eight years of uninterrupted expansion, the economies of the vast majority of the countries in the South have either stagnated or even declined. This emerging dual pattern in the economic performance of Member States of the Organisation is attributable to many factors. Some of these factors are the escalating debt burden, the sharp fall in commodity prices, protectionism, the decline in foreign investment, and the net transfer of resources from the developing to the developed nations. It is indeed a fact that the developed countries have not pursued or sustained policies that aid the economic growth of developing countries.
The pervasive and deep decline among developing countries in the 1980s indicates that poor domestic economic management is not the main culprit for their economic woes as commonly suggested. The fact is that the external shocks of the 1980s have had a devastating impact on many of our economies. Nigeria's plight and experience is very illustrative. Our oil export revenue fell by 75 per cent between 1980 and 1986. On the other hand, our external debt rose from $3.4 billion in 1978 to $30.7 billion in 1988, due in large measure to a sharp rise in interest rates. The combined effects of these externally-induced shocks have led to s dramatic reduction in the living standards of our people.
In the period 1989 to 1990 the total debt stock of all developing countries stood at $1,300 billion. That figure is nearly twice our export earnings, with our annual interest obligations currently at about $100 billion. And the debt, of course, is still growing.
On our continent, Africa, total debt stock rose from approximately $48 billion in 1978 to an estimated $250 billion in 1989. The effect of this debt burden on sub-Saharan Africa has been devastating. By the end of 1988, sub-Saharan African debt was equal to its gross national product and three and a half times its export earnings. Most countries in the sub-region have found it impossible to meet debt-servicing obligations African countries have had to bear debt-servicing obligations averaging between 35 per cent to 40 per cent of their export earnings, a most punishing burden for such low-income economies to bear.
As a result of the negative net transfer of resources, principally arising from debt-servicing, developing countries have suffered painful reductions in income. Consequently, within the decade of the 1980s, six African countries were reclassified from middle-income to low-income economies. On this scale of dismal economic performance, arising from an unfavourable international economic environment, the number of African countries classified as least developed countries increased from 17 to 28. There is a real fear that this number will increase if present global economic policies are not redressed.
The Nigerian delegation calls on the major industrialised countries to exhibit the political will needed to address and resolve the main economic problems of our particularly the debt problem. The resolution of the debt problem, will significantly reduce the pernicious phenomena of the negative transfer of resources and therein release resources needed for development and growth.
We recognise that effective solutions to the debt problem must be the joint responsibility of debtor and creditor countries as well as the multilateral financial institutions and the commercial banks. Recent initiatives aimed at the reduction of the debt stock and debt service are well conceived. However, these initiatives are not sufficiently far-reaching to deal with the profound crisis that has already wrecked and prevented the growth of the economies of many developing countries. What is required is co-ordinated and intensified international economic co-operation to address the economic problems of our era, as well as the proposal, adoption and implementation of durable, far-reaching and forward-looking solutions.
We urge the developed nations to rise to the challenge posed by the debt problem. Effective measures should be devised and implemented that would remove the other obstacles that impede the rapid economic development of the developing countries. We know that we have the ultimate responsibility for our development. In this regard, we in Nigeria have embarked on major reforms and restructuring of our economy. In spite of these measures, the flow of foreign investment and capital into our economy has not matched our expectations and sacrifices. The growth and development of our economies will not reach their full potential without profound structural changes in the global economic and financial system. 
Related to the question of economic development is the issue of disarmament. In our view, the question of disarmament is not only restricted to the immediate benefit of the preservation of life, although that is important, but also to the relationship between disarmament and development. The disarmament question is, therefore, important in terms of both military and non-military security.
Recent developments in disarmament negotiations gave us grounds for hope. Unfortunately, this hope has not been justified, and the expectations of the 'peace dividend' are rapidly receding.
An important component of our common security must be a binding universal acceptance of the principle of the non-use of force in resolving international disputes. Such a security system must also involve deep reductions in existing global stocks of nuclear and conventional weapons, armed forces and related expenditure, which are draining the world's limited resources and impoverishing humanity.
In our region, Nigeria is proud to be associated with the various efforts towards regional peace and security. The turning of Africa into a nuclear-free zone, as embodied in the 1964 Declaration of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), remains our goal. Our commitment to the strengthening of peace and security in the South Atlantic region is solid. We demonstrated this commitment when, earlier this year, we hosted the Second Meeting of the States of the Zone of Peace and Co-operation of the South Atlantic in Abuja, during which concrete decisions on the practical ways of accelerating the objectives of the zone were reached.
We must preserve our environment. Irreparable damage to our environment will have tragic consequences for our civilisation. Environmental degradation caused by the negative effects of scientific and technological development has, in many cases, already led to adverse changes in the environment. These changes threaten the life-sustaining eco-systems and pose a threat to the health and well-being of mankind. There is therefore, an urgent and compelling need for global action to deal with such environmental issues as deforestation, desertification, protection of the ozone layer and more rational use of land and water resources and energy.
Developing countries are highly vulnerable to environmental degradation.
Owing to the low levels of technological development, our countries are ill-equipped to deal effectively with the complex problems of environmental abuse. Consequently, the developed countries bear a special responsibility to promote environmentally sound policies that will contribute to sustainable development.
International development co-operation for environmental protection should be a central task for this decade. Development co-operation must be based on respect for nationally determined goals and priorities. However, we should not be expected to accept development assistance on terns which are detrimental to our national development. There is now an urgent need for all countries to put in place effective standards for the disposal of toxic wastes within their own borders. Rigorous standards should also be observed for the trans-boundary movement of toxic wastes. Under no conditions should toxic and hazardous wastes be sent to countries that are technologically incapable of their safe disposal.
We have recently set up the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, because of the importance the government of Nigeria attaches to environmental protection and security. In this regard, we look forward to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, which will take place in Brazil in 1992.
Human rights are of cardinal importance. The promotion of the well-being of the individual, and respect for and observance of his fundamental rights are directly related to the progress of the individual and his society. We hold the view that, whatever the historical background or the material circumstances of peoples, their civil and political rights, on the one hand, end their economic, social and cultural rights, on the other, are indivisible and interdependent category of right is more important than the other. Governments that engage in the flagrant violation of the rights of their people provoke crisis, conflict and instability. Although much remains to be done in the area of peace, the United Nations has been impressive in setting standards in this field.
At its forty-fourth session, the General Assembly requested the views of governments on the need to convene a world conference on human rights. Therefore,  Mr. President, e affirm our support for this call. Nigeria is strongly committed to the principle of political pluralism. In this connection, we have commenced the process of democratisation of our governmental system. We have embarked on a political transition programme to full democracy, which will lead to the election of a democratic government. Indeed, the third tier of government would be elected in December this year.
The problem of production, supply, demand, trafficking and distribution of narcotic drugs is one of increasing concern. A comprehensive approach is required to deal with this problem. Bold and concerted international and national action is required. Consequently, we have established the National Law Enforcement Agency to deal with the problem. We are co-operating with other governments to ensure the effectiveness of the campaign against drug trafficking and consumption. However, only a solution that addresses the demand and supply aspects of the problem has any chance of success.
One of our objectives in Africa is to promote peace and security. It is in this context that the Economic Community of West African States seats a peace-keeping force to Liberia. Our goals are to facilitate a cease-fire among the different warring groups, to protect the lives of Liberians and other nationals. To create stable security conditions in the country, and to create an atmosphere conducive to the installing of a democratically elected government.
We hope that the international community will support this peace process.
There is a serious refugee problem in the subregion arising from the Liberian conflict. We appeal to the international community for urgent humanitarian assistance. We also call for logistic and other related assistance to the ECOWAS Monitoring Group (EC0M0G) in its peace-keeping operations.
The situation in southern Africa remains of primary concern to my country.
This year has truly witnessed important developments in southern Africa. These developments are a result of our collective and individual resolve to eradicate the method of apartheid, which dehumanises both its victims and its perpetrators alike. Nigeria, indeed Africa and the entire international community celebrated the release of Mr. Nelson Mandela. We welcome the dialogue between the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and the Government of South Africa. Nigeria notes with interest the opening of the National Party to all races. We also welcome the recent meeting between representatives of other political groups within South Africa. Notwithstanding these positive changes, we must not forget that the major pillars of apartheid remain intact. The racist Constitution remains the basic law in South Africa. Black South Africans are still victims of oppression, of hatred and of direct and inspired racist killings. We urge the international community to maintain existing sanctions against South Africa until the establishment of a free, non-racial, democratic and undivided South Africa. The international community cannot accept anything less. 

The consensus Declaration ,adopted by the General Assembly at its sixteenth special session provides the framework for the peaceful elimination of apartheid and the resolution of the crises in southern Africa. Elsewhere in the region, particularly is Angola and Mozambique, we hope that the different groups involved in civil conflicts will have recourse to negotiations, dialogue and other peaceful means is the resolution of their differences. We shall continue, as is the past, to play our part as peace-makers.
On Western Sahara, Nigeria notes with satisfaction the recent actions by the Secretary-General and the Security Council. We welcome the adoption of the initial report of the Secretary-General on the proposed implementations of the joist OAU-United Nations proposal for the peaceful settlement of the crisis. We are prepared to play any suitable role is the proposed United Nations mission for the referendum in Wasters Sahara. In other areas of conflict, such as Kampuchea, Central America and Afghanistan, Nigeria will continue to support and encourage regional and international efforts for attaining peace, security and stability.
Nigeria welcomed the recent meeting of the Prime Ministers of the two Koreas. We hope that such contacts will further advance efforts towards peaceful reunification. That is without prejudice to the desire of the Korean people for membership of the United Nations.
The question of a homeland for the Palestinians is at the heart of the Middle East problem. The Palestinians must be allowed to enjoy their right to self-determination. The lessons of the past and the present show that, as Members of the United Nations committed to the maintenance of international peace and security, we should never be complacent. The struggle to achieve peace and security is a never-ending one. In spite of the gains resulting primarily from increased super-Power co-operation, recent events show that obstacles remain. This must compel us to be more vigilant.
Politics and economics are interwoven. It is therefore regrettable that the same concern and commitment in global political and security matters have not yet been extended to the economic well-being of most of the developing countries. Africa remains marginalised in the evolving world order. In spite of our best efforts at economic development, poverty has become more widespread in our continent. This, I believe, poses a threat to world peace and security.
None the less, as we peer into the future we are full of hope. We are confident that we shall reach our collective goal of a peaceful world devoid of man-made injustice. The Government and the people of Nigeria will not only dream, but will continue to work tirelessly for an Africa that is socially at peace, economically developed and politically plural and democratic. To achieve this we ask for the understanding and co-operation of the international community. Indeed, we ask for genuine partnership. We need partnership to uproot the scourge of apartheid and racism. We need partnership to eliminate and banish large-scale poverty and disease. We need partnership to check environmental degradation. We need partnership to promote respect for human rights in all their ramifications. And we need partnership to advance the process of political democratisation on our continent. Above all, as Members of this Organisation, we need to summon the political will to increase and sustain the commitment to a humane and just world economic order. 





1991

It is a great honour for me to address this Assembly, both as President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and as the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). In those capacities. Sir, may I congratulate you on your election as President of this forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Your election is undoubtedly a great tribute to your talents and a recognition of the contributions of your country to furthering the ideals of the United Nations. I am confident that under your able guidance the deliberations of this session will be brought to a fruitful conclusion.
I wish also to pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco of Malta, for the able manner in which he conducted the affairs of the last session.
I would like to express my profound appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, who for the past 10 years has put his sterling qualities at the service of our Organisation. His outstanding contributions as an advocate of peace and his support for the cause of the underprivileged have endeared him to the international community. As his terra of office draws to a close, I wish him good luck in his future endeavours.
From a membership of 51 in 1945, the United Nations has grown to an Organization of 166 States with the admission at this session of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republics of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. I join in the welcome that has been extended to them.
In the four and a half decades of the existence of the United Nations, the prospects for building a safe and secure world for all mankind have never been brighter. The end of the cold war, the dramatic changes in Eastern Europe, the encouraging agreements concluded by the United States and the Soviet Union in the field of nuclear disarmament coupled with the latest unilateral measures announced by President George Bush, the progress achieved in the resolution of regional conflicts and the growing convergence of views on democratisation and its linkage with development have all combined to create a climate more conducive to genuine international cooperation.
The challenge to the international community, therefore, is to seize this opportunity to establish a new world order in which the United Nations will be the instrument for the promotion and maintenance of international peace and security, for the harmonization of the interests of all States and for the promotion of global prosperity. This new world order must be collectively defined, collectively designed and collectively defended.
Africa, like other parts of the world, is adjusting to recent dramatic global developments. Our peoples are taking a critical look at the conduct of politics and the changes necessary to bring about stability, security and development. For that reason, the issues of democratisation, of human rights and of popular participation in political and economic processes have assumed important dimensions in the deliberations of the OAU.
In June 1991, the OAU, at its summit meeting in Abuja, the new Nigerian capital, deliberated again on these issues. The summit resolved that African countries should fully embrace the democratic culture in order to enable our peoples to enjoy fundamental human rights and participate effectively in decisions that affect their lives and their well-being. Naturally, models of democratisation must vary and must take into account differing cultures and other environmental factors. Each country is therefore evolving its variant of democracy at a different pace of development.
In Nigeria, for example, the Transition to Civil Rule Programme is a carefully phased process in which democratic government is expected to proceed with political learning, institutional adjustment and the reorientation of political culture. By the end of 1992, we will have held elections to all tiers of Government and completed the transition programme that was launched in 1986. Other approaches to democratisation, especially the National Conference variety, have entailed the rapid displacement of incumbent managers of State by transitional leaders who, in turn, will commence the process of transition.
Economic development nurtures democracy. However, underdevelopment is a threat and obstacle to democracy. We commend the peoples of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union for their decision to build democratic societies. We also note the significant financial and economic assistance that the Western industrialized countries and Japan have decided to offer them. This is in direct contrast to the virtual neglect of African efforts. If this neglect and this indifference continue, disillusionment may arise with democracy in the face of persistent and extreme economic hardship.
Aware of this inter-relationship between democracy and development, many countries in Africa are pursuing economic reform side by side with the restructuring of the political processes. Self-reliance is the cornerstone of our new thinking on economic reform. At the individual country level, we have embarked upon structural adjustment programmes designed to liberalize our economies. Through deregulation, we expect the private sector to play the leading role in revitalizing our economies. At the continental level, at our summit meeting, held in Abuja last June, we adopted the Treaty establishing the African Economic Community, with the objective of creating an integrated common market. Our goal is a fully developed Africa, able to feed itself, capable of being the engine of its own growth and able to participate actively in the world economic system. Structural adjustment in Africa, without a conducive international environment, seems incapable of turning our economy around and ensuring the stability of our polity. It must be said that Africa's efforts have not received the requisite international support.
May I recall that in June 1986 the United Nations adopted the Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development, which covered the period from 1986 to 1990. A review of the Programme showed that its implementation was most unsatisfactory. Hence, the overall performance of the African economy since 1986 has been dismal. The reasons can be attributed mainly to the debt burden, the collapse of commodity prices, the low levels of resource flows from the developed countries, as well as natural calamities.
Disappointed by the poor performance of the Programme of Action, African countries decided to present a New Agenda of Action for the Development of Africa in the 1990s, rather than approach the international community for a second programme of action. The Agenda envisages that the African gross domestic product as a whole must grow by at least 6 per cent per annum in real terms in order to enable the continent to double per capita income by the year 2015. This level of growth will require $30 billion in resources during 1992.
We expect that the international community, in cooperation with Africa, will now strive to see that the New Agenda is implemented in accordance with Africa's needs and aspirations. The international community must accept the principle of shared responsibility and full partnership with Africa, and firmly commit itself to giving far more support than it did during the period from 1986 to date. Africa is not, and should not, be made an irrelevant, variable in the world development equation. The United Nations must play a decisive role in Africa's quest and determination to overcome its stalled deve1opment.
May I emphasise that Africa's indebtedness is the single major obstacle to development in the continent. The debt problem is a central element of Africa's critical economic situation. Africa's debt is crippling. The realities are as startling as they are depressing. Africa's total debt equals 102.3 per cent of its gross national product and more than 300 per cent of its total exports. On average, 30 per cent of the continent's export earnings is used to service debt. For the least developed countries, the percentage is more than double the average. He cannot continue in this way.
There is an urgent need for political dialogue between the creditor nations and the debtor nations on the debt crisis. Let us consider the idea of debt forgiveness for credible and sustained structural adjustment programmes. Let us consider the idea of debt forgiveness for credible environmental protection programmes. Let us consider the idea of debt forgiveness for credible democratisation processes.
Beyond the issue of debt, what Africa needs is a special financial package, a kind of Marshall Plan, which would demonstrate the sincerity of the developed world for the plight of Africa, right historical wrongs and set the world on the path of a new order that is just and equitable.
In recent times, the world has been concerned about such major environmental problems as the depletion of the ozone layer, global warming, acid rain and hazardous and toxic waste dumping. Africa's environmental problems of drought, deforestation, desertification and erosion are no less severe than the environmental problems of industrialized countries. We have, within our limited resources, made efforts to contain environmental degradation which, in the developing countries, is closely linked to poverty and underdevelopment. The promotion of economic and social development therefore, constitutes an essential factor in the protection of the environment.
As we look forward to the forthcoming United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, we urge the international community to commit itself fully to the pursuit of environmentally sound technology, which will available to all countries. In order to fulfil that commitment, the Conference should set up an international mechanism to implement a truly global programme of action. Such a programme should embrace all aspects of the threat to the environment, without prejudice to the development aspirations of Africa and other developing regions.
The positive and dramatic changes in the world have facilitated the resolution of some regional conflicts. He are however concerned that a number of other conflicts, the continuation of which threatens international peace and security, remain unresolved. We urge all countries concerned to avail themselves of the present international climate to seek peaceful solutions to their disputes under the aegis of the United Nations and of their regional organizations.
The Organization of African Unity (OAU) continues to seek ways to improve its machinery for resolving African conflicts and for bringing enduring peace to our continent. Currently we are seeking solutions to the conflicts in the Sudan, Somalia and Rwanda. As Chairman of the OAU I am personally engaged in these processes.
At the subregional level, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) continues to be actively involved, at great cost to its members, in helping the people of Liberia bring peace to their country. A special ECOWAS committee was established in July to take a fresh look at ways and means of advancing the peace process in Liberia. We are gratified that agreement was reached by all parties to the conflict to encamp and disarm the warring factions and to establish an electoral commission to conduct legislative and presidential elections.
I want to use the privilege of this occasion once again to appeal to our brothers in Africa to bury the hatchet and seek a peaceful settlement of the problems that have torn them and their countries apart.
This Assembly has, for over 30 years, supported the aspirations of the people of southern Africa for the establishment of a non-racial democratic society. In line with that position the Assembly declared apartheid a crime against humanity and proceeded to recommend the imposition of sanctions on the South African regime. These years of international pressure, and the struggle of the people of southern Africa, have had a great impact on the thinking and, consequently, the policies of the Government of South Africa.
At the last OAU Summit we took cognisance of the positive changes that had taken place in that country. We welcomed them. The United Nations must take great satisfaction and pride in its own significant contribution to bringing about the changes. Lovers of freedom and all those who suffered, all those who are still suffering, and those who paid the supreme sacrifice must be commended on the progress made towards the dawn of a new order in southern Africa.
South Africa has yet to arrive at the final destination. The international community must, therefore, remain vigilant until the goals of freedom, justice and a non-racial and democratic society are achieved in South Africa.
We note the effort to stamp out communal violence resulting in the meeting which took place in Johannesburg on 14 September 1991, during which a national peace accord was signed by the African National Congress, the Inkatha Freedom Party and the National Party. We commend all those responsible for this agreement.
We recognize that cooperation between a new South Africa and other African countries with the requisite potential can act as a catalyst for economic growth and development. Africa is prepared to welcome a new, non-racial and democratic South Africa as a respectable member of the comity of nations and to establish normal and fruitful relations with it. More than at any time in the past the Middle East is now on the threshold of a major peace effort. Recent developments, particularly the agreement to convene a peace conference, have indeed strengthened our conviction that the road to peace in the region is through negotiation and not war. We congratulate all those who are working tirelessly for the convening of the peace conference. It behoves all parties to the conflict to demonstrate their desire for peace. We therefore appeal to them to spare no effort in order to arrive at a just and durable solution that will guarantee peaceful coexistence in the region.
During the Gulf War, the world was gripped with fear over the possible use of chemical weapons. We in Africa have always emphasized that nations should not only forswear the use of these weapons, as stipulated in the 1925 Geneva Protocol, but also support the complete prohibition of their development, production and stockpiling, as well as their elimination from the arsenals of those who possess them. We therefore call for the urgent conclusion of the chemical weapons convention.
We note with satisfaction the agreement reached so far between the United States and the Soviet Union in the field of nuclear disarmament. We congratulate President George Bush on the far-reaching initiatives he announced a few days ago and we equally welcome the prompt response by President Mikhail Gorbachev. Those acts of statesmanship represent a significant milestone in efforts to avert a nuclear catastrophe.
We in Africa have taken concrete steps in the pursuit of our long-standing Declaration to make our continent a nuclear-weapon-free zone. Africa is equally concerned about the increasing proliferation of conventional weapons. Given their destructive capacity, their threat to international peace and security and the enormous human and financial drain they constitute to all nations, especially the developing countries, the international community should begin in earnest to address the question of the arms race in conventional weapons in a constructive and non-discriminatory manner.
In a few years' time, the United Nations will mark its golden jubilee. In the four and a half decades of its existence it has provided the forum for defusing tensions through dialogue, even where it could not resolve the issues. It has been the catalyst for the ending of colonialism and for the realization of the fundamental rights of peoples to self-determination and independence.
The United Nations Charter embodies principles that are fundamental to the achievement of peace. It is our duty, therefore, to strengthen the Organization. In doing so we must strive to adapt its major organs to the realities of today and to the demands of tomorrow.
It is time to address in a very serious manner the composition of the Security Council. It is one major organ of the United Nations that needs to be democratized. Its membership of 15 has become inadequate in view of the expanded membership of the United Nations since 1965 when the Security Council was last enlarged. The limitation of the permanent membership to the present five has become both anachronistic and unrepresentative.
The logic of democracy cannot be confined within the borders of individual States, but must, of necessity, be applicable to the operation of international organizations. It is therefore our considered opinion that there is need to expand the membership of the Security Council and to admit additional permanent members representing all the regions of the world. 
The deep commitment of African States to the United Nations has been demonstrated over the years. As a further mark of that commitment the Organisation of African Unity has presented a list of distinguished candidates for consideration to serve the Organisation in the capacity of Secretary-General. Africa's case for the office has been misinterpreted to mean special pleading. Our case is based on competence and justice. Africa is set to give the world its best in the pursuit of the lofty goals that informed the establishment of the United Nations. Africa therefore calls upon the rest of the world to apply a proper sense of justice in considering the appointment of a new United Nations Secretary-General. We strongly believe that the next Secretary-General should be an African.
For us in Africa, a new world order should give primacy to the United Nations, which should be revitalised to fulfil its mandate under the Charter as the principal Instrument for the maintenance of international peace and security. It should be a forum for harmonizing the interests of the strong and the weak. All countries must recognize the universal applicability of international law because the future of humanity ultimately depends on that recognition.
In addition, for the new world order to be truly equitable all Members of the United Nations should commit themselves to the principle that prosperity, like security, is indivisible. The persistent neglect of the economic circumstances of most countries in the third world puts at great risk lasting harmony in inter-State relations. The division of the world into a rich minority and a poor majority poses a threat to international peace and security. In the recent past the world has seen the end of certain rigidities in international political relations. This has given us all new hope. Let us also eliminate the rigidities in international economic and financial relations.
We urge nine years from the end of a momentous century, one that has witnessed wars, liberation and man's conquest of space. Let us create a new world order that would be beneficial to all. Let all nations resolve to make this last decade of the century a decade of peace, a decade of security and stability, a decade of racial harmony and a decade for development.




1992

On behalf of the Nigerian delegation, I
congratulate you. Sir, on your election as President of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. Your election is testimony to your sterling qualities as a statesman and a diplomat.
I wish also to pay tribute to your distinguished predecessor.
His Excellency Mr. Samir Shihabi of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, for the outstanding manner in which he steered the affairs of the General Assembly during its forty-sixth session.
I wish to express on behalf of President Babangida, the Government and the people of Nigeria our appreciation to the many delegations which sent us messages of condolence following the loss of lives resulting from the tragic plane crash near Lagos.
I should also like to take this opportunity to commend Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for the admirable manner in which he has been performing his duties as Secretary-General of the United Nations. I am confident that Mr. Boutros-Ghali, an accomplished diplomat, a distinguished statesman and a scholar of repute, will remain true to the worthy ideals of our Organization and bring his versatile experience to bear on the crucial issues confronting the international community.
Nigeria welcomes the new Members of our Organization. Their participation will enrich our discussions and strengthen international legitimacy and the rule of law.
I should also like to take this opportunity to inform the Assembly that in January 1993 Nigeria will complete its transition to democracy with the handing over of power to an elected Government. As you are aware, elected governments at the local and state levels are already in place. Elections to  the Senate and the House of Representatives have also been concluded. Our untiring efforts to evolving a democratic arrangement suited to our environment reflect our commitment to pluralism and dialog.
In no other period in this century has there been greater hope for global peace and security than now. The end of the cold war, the noteworthy efforts in the field of nuclear disarmament and the ever-widening circle of democracy all promise to create an international environment that is more conducive to the attainment of international peace and security.
However, many problems still threaten our quest for global peace, cooperation and development. In some parts of the world, political conflicts have degenerated into violence. We are also witnessing the resurgence of long-dormant ethnic and boundary disputes in Europe. Indeed, no region of the world today is spared the scourge of war. These wars have drained states and the international community of resources that could have been used for development. 
Africa, in particular, has experienced severe and persistent strife, especially in Sudan, Western Sahara, Somalia, Liberia and Rwanda. These conflicts have caused untold hardship, economic dislocation and a massive refugee burden. In addition, the conflicts have worsened Africa's weak economic condition and made more distant our hope for growth and development.
In accordance with its obligations under the Charters of the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations, Africa has continued to make efforts to settle these conflicts. Nigeria, for instance, hosted a peace conference on Sudan in May 1992 and also undertook a mission to Somalia to urge the various factions to resolve their differences peacefully. In Liberia/ we continue to work through the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in search of peace. We remain, as ever, committed to the restoration of lasting peace in that country. The ECOWAS Cease-fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) is an admirable example of regional arrangements recommended under Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. It should not be allowed to fail. We appeal to all the parties in Liberia to cooperate with ECOWAS in implementing the agreements reached so far. The international community, particularly the United Nations, should complement our regional peace-keeping and peacemaking efforts through greater involvement and increased humanitarian assistance.
The situation in Western Sahara continues to be a source of great concern. We commend the efforts of the Secretary-General to revive the stalled peace process. Nigeria believes strongly that the joint peace plan of the United Nations and the Organization for African Unity provides the best framework for ensuring peace while safeguarding the right to self-determination of the people of Western Sahara.
In response to pressures from the international community, change is indeed taking place in South Africa, and we welcome it. However, the difficulties in maintaining the momentum of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) talks give serious cause for concern. We urge the South African Government to intensify efforts to ensure an environment conducive to completing the transition to a non-racial democratic South Africa. The threat
to CODESA by anti-democratic forces must not be allowed to succeed.
But more importantly, and as a measure of its commitment to democratic rule, the South African Government should agree to the immediate establishment of an interim government of national unity that will supervise the transition to a democratic order. The role of the United Nations remains crucial in this process. That is why we welcome the dispatch of United Nations observers to South Africa. He call on the Organization to increase the number of observers to enable them to oversee the transition more effectively.
The Nigerian Government applauds the recent efforts to advance the peace process in the Middle East. The present international climate is conducive to negotiation and compromise. He urge all parties to the Middle East conflict to take advantage of this momentous period in history to find a just and lasting solution to all aspects of the conflict. Such a lasting peace can be built only on a foundation that assures justice for all and the peaceful coexistence of all States in the Middle East, in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).
For the past few months the people of what was formerly Yugoslavia have not known peace. The parties to the conflict should heed the appeal of the international community by respecting cease-fire agreements and by resolving their differences through negotiations. They owe their people and us all the sacred duty of achieving peace.
There cannot be security in our world so long as nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction exist. As the United Nations begins discussion on extending the non-proliferation Treaty, all nations should place at the fore of that debate the objective of achieving a comprehensive nuclear-test ban.
The chemical weapons Convention, which was recently concluded, represents a
significant milestone in the history of disarmament. Nigeria will sign the Convention and urges all States to do the same.
As the Assembly is aware. Member States spend over $1 trillion annually on armaments. This huge expenditure is no longer necessary as States move to an era of cooperation and peace. Expenditure on armaments should be sharply reduced in order to divert resources from this sector to development programs world wide.
The economies of African States continue to be depressed by the debt burden, unfavorable commodity prices, net outflow of resources and protectionist trade policies. There is need for new funds to be injected into Africa to reverse the continent's economic decline. He acknowledge that our economic recovery and development depends primarily on the policies pursued by African Governments. However, the success of such policies rests in part on the fairness of the international economic system and the transfer to African States of adequate resources to enhance our growth-oriented policies.
The Rio Summit in our view was a success. The effective implementation of Agenda 21 programs depends on the provision of financial resources to match the commitments. While we appreciate the support of the international community on the questions of desertification and drought, which are causing extensive environmental degradation in Africa, we appeal to all Member States fully to support the setting up of an intergovernmental negotiating committee to prepare an international convention on desertification. We also expect that the composition of a commission on sustainable development will be finalized at this session of the General Assembly.
At its summit meeting in January this year, the Security Council reoriented itself to pursue the objective of preventive diplomacy, of peacemaking and peace-keeping within the ambit of its responsibility. The Secretary-General has now produced a report entitled 'An Agenda for Peace' with far-reaching implications for our Organization. My delegation notes with appreciation the recommendations contained in that report, especially with respect to the role of regional and subregional arrangements in promoting international peace.
Almost half a century ago the United Nations had 51 Members. The Membership has now grown to 179. The Security Council, which is vested with the primary responsibility of dealing with issues of international peace and security, has maintained its permanent membership of five. In his address to the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session, the President of Nigeria, then in his capacity as Chairman of the Organization of African Unity, said: 'The limitation of the permanent membership to the present five has become both anachronistic and unrepresentative.
The composition of the permanent membership of the Security Council represents three out of five regions. Seen in the North-South context, four of its members come from the North. In addition, new demands on the issue have emerged with the recent changes in the international system. The parameters of democracy as well as size and role within the global system have become relevant criteria for adjudging the issue of representation.
The need to increase the number of permanent seats in the Security Council is in our view an idea whose time has come. Therefore, it should be a matter of principle for the international community that Africa must not continue to be a region without representation in the permanent membership of the Security Council. Nigeria, the most populous African nation, with the largest economic potential and its proven commitment to the cause of world
peace and security, possesses the qualifications to fulfill Africa's aspirations in this regard.
Let me seize this opportunity to place on record our appreciation for the courage of the Secretary-General in drawing the attention of the international community to the situation in Somalia. Since then events have shown that that courage was not misplaced. In the same vein, we expect that the Secretary-General will ensure that Africans are adequately represented in the upper echelons of the United Nations Secretariat.
As we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the Organization, let us rededicate ourselves to the ideals enshrined in the Charter. The gains manifested in the political and security fields in recent times must be matched by corresponding gains in the economic and social fields. For this to materialize, we must strengthen international cooperation in tackling the economic and social challenges facing our world. My delegation looks forward to the crystallization of such cooperation. He must therefore resolve to eradicate poverty, ignorance and disease; promote and protect human rights in all their facets; prevent the degradation of the environment; eliminate war as an instrument of State policy; and, above all, promote a virile, efficient and democratic United Nations. 





1993


It is a great honour and
privilege, Sir, for me to address this Assembly under your
presidency. Your election is a tribute to you and to your
great country, Guyana. It furthermore attests to the
international community’s confidence in your ability to carry
out the duties of President of the General Assembly during
the next 12 months. I have no doubt that, given your
sterling qualities, you will guide this session to a successful
conclusion.
I also wish to commend your distinguished predecessor,
His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev of the Republic of
Bulgaria, for the able and outstanding manner in which he
conducted the affairs of the forty-seventh session.
I would also like to express my delegation’s
acknowledgement of the dedicated manner in which the
Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has been
directing the work of our Organization during this crucial
period.
On behalf of the Government and the people of Nigeria,
I welcome all the new Member States, fully confident of the
useful contribution they can make in furtherance of the noble
objectives of the United Nations.
The relevance of our great Organization to the solution
of the common problems facing humanity is more manifest
today than at any time in our history. The complexity of
these pressing concerns and the need to act rapidly and with
resolve demand a greater degree of concerted efforts by
members of the international community. Events happening
around us demonstrate the urgency of this imperative. In the
last few years, the international landscape has witnessed
unprecedented transformations and rapid changes. The cold
war has become a thing of the past. Progress has been made
in nuclear disarmament. The wave of democratization which
has been sweeping across the world has not diminished in
intensity or breadth. The search for greater prosperity
through emerging regional economic arrangements is
spreading.
In spite of the inherent benefits of all these
developments, no sooner do we succeed in resolving one set
of problems than we are confronted with new and more
challenging ones. Indeed, the promise of global peace and

security and the vision of a new world order are inhibited by
political and ethnic conflicts, economic and social disorder,
and deepening poverty, particularly in developing countries.
In this connection, the consequences of feeble gestures
or inaction are just too frightening to contemplate. It is
therefore necessary to draw attention to the major concerns
so that they can be fully addressed with a view to finding
lasting solutions which are just and beneficial to every
member of the international community.
In view of the positive changes in the international
political environment, the United Nations has been placed at
the centre of conflict resolution, having been accorded its
rightful place in the promotion and maintenance of
international peace and security. Unfortunately, our
Organization is being overwhelmed by the avalanche of
conflicts which it is suddenly called upon to resolve.
Practically all regions of the world are embroiled in one
conflict or another. No region, however, is as afflicted as
Africa, either in the number of conflicts currently raging or
in their unimaginable negative effects on people. In one
conflict alone - that of Angola - as many as 1,000 people are
reported to be dying each day. Angola is not alone in the
unenviable situation created by civil conflict: Sudan,
Somalia and Liberia can be cited.
Regional conflicts constitute a key threat to the
achievement of global peace and security. This is why we
welcome the active and increased involvement of the United
Nations in peace-keeping and peace-building efforts. The
role of our Organization in these areas will continue to
expand as more States call on it for assistance in preventing
or containing conflicts. Member States have the duty to
support fully the work of the Organization in this very
important role. They must be prepared to provide the
Organization with the resources and the personnel it requires
to cope with ever-growing peace-keeping demands. The
price of peace may be high; we must be conscious, however,
that it is a far better bargain compared with the price of war.
In this connection, the recent mammoth and multifaceted
peace-keeping operation in Cambodia gives cause for great
optimism.
The United Nations must direct its peace-keeping
operations in a manner that does not jeopardize its integrity
or expose its peace-keepers to avoidable danger.
Furthermore, it must be made clear to those who commit
acts of aggression against United Nations peace-keepers that
they will be adjudged guilty of crimes against the
international community. The safety of United Nations
peace-keepers is of utmost concern to countries which, like
Nigeria, participate in many operations within and outside
Africa.
I recall that, while on peace-keeping duty in the former
Yugoslavia, Nigerian troops were subjected to attack
resulting in casualties. The same is happening in Somalia,
where Pakistani, Italian, Nigerian, American and Malaysian
peace-keepers have been brutally killed. The national
trauma occasioned by the loss of lives in United Nations
peace-keeping missions gives rise to anxieties and doubts.
However, I wish to assure this body that Nigeria will
continue to demonstrate its commitment to the United
Nations by continued participation in its peace-keeping
operations.
It is in this same spirit of service that Nigeria is seeking
election to the Security Council this year. I hope that
Member States will give their valuable support to Nigeria’s
candidature.
In Africa, we have also made great efforts to contain
and resolve conflicts in our continent. Nigeria has been
involved in many of these efforts to bring peace to embattled
areas. At the bilateral level, we hosted peace conferences of
the parties to the conflict in the Sudan. We have, through
the Organization of African Unity, joined other African
States to monitor the cease-fire in Rwanda. In Liberia,
Nigeria has been the moving force in the regional effort to
bring peace to that war-torn country through the Military
Observer Group (ECOMOG) of the Economic Community
of West African States.
Because of positive developments in Liberia, we have
indicated our intention to withdraw our troops at the
appropriate time. This decision was based on the successful
conclusion and acceptance of the Cotonou Agreement. All
the parties to the conflict and the international community
accept the Cotonou Agreement as the basis for durable peace
in Liberia. If, as we hope, the accord is faithfully
implemented, a democratically elected Government will have
been installed in Liberia within the time-frame envisaged for
the withdrawal of our troops. While we do not, therefore,
contemplate a premature withdrawal, through this forum I
call upon the international community to bear in mind that
Nigeria has expended and continues to expend a significant
amount in the peace-keeping operation in Liberia. Urgent
international support to the ECOMOG effort has become
crucial. Nigeria therefore welcomes Security Council
resolution 866 (1993) of 21 September 1993, which set up
the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL)
and called upon Member States to support the peace process
in Liberia by contributing to the Trust Fund being
Forty-eighth session - 7 October l993 3
established by the Secretary-General. Early implementation
will be absolutely necessary to sustain the process.
A cheering development in our continent is taking place
in South Africa, where a democratic Government is now
within sight. The doyen of South African nationalists,
Nelson Mandela, confirmed the irreversibility of the march
towards an apartheid-free society in his statement in this
Hall two weeks ago. As evidence of his conviction, he
called for the lifting of the remaining economic sanctions on
South Africa. I wish, in the name of Nigeria, to congratulate
South African leaders, black and white, who in the past two
years have shown great statesmanship in the negotiations that
have resulted in the establishment by law of the Transitional
Executive Council.
South Africa has come a long way out of its apartheid-
induced isolation. The international community should assist
the South Africans in completing the process of full
integration into the international system. To this end, those
responsible for the mindless violence occurring daily should
be unreservedly condemned. All South Africans should
realize that the watchful eyes of the international community
continue to be focused on their country.
Nigeria will take immediate steps to respond to
Nelson Mandela’s call for economic cooperation with South
Africa. We shall also commence such contacts with the
Transitional Executive Council, when it is physically
established, as will facilitate diplomatic interaction at the
appropriate time.
The road to democracy and the nurturing of democratic
institutions in Africa have not been smooth. Indeed, the
democratic enterprise in Africa faces many problems.
Africa’s economic underdevelopment and high level of
illiteracy constitute major impediments to our attainment of
democracy in its modern concept.
But such has been our fascination with democracy as a
value deeply rooted in our culture that we in Africa have
willingly decided to face up to the challenge of putting in
place an enduring system of democratic governance in our
respective countries. I can say confidently that this is an
enterprise my country has taken seriously. Our programme
of transition from military to civilian rule has not been
without its difficult moments. However, we have not
allowed them to deter us from our cherished goal. We are
determined not to repeat the mistakes of our earlier attempts
to evolve a system that would preserve the corporate unity
of our country. It was, therefore, to ensure that the
democratic process could be completed within the shortest
possible period - indeed, by March 1994 - that the Interim
National Government, which I have the honour and privilege
to lead, was seen as the most viable option to ease the
military out of power without bloodshed.
We in Nigeria fully understand and appreciate the
interest and concern shown by the international community
regarding recent political events in our country. After all,
democratization has become a major component of the
emerging new world order. We therefore appeal for the
understanding of the international community in this difficult
period in our nation’s history. I can assure this Assembly
that we are working very hard to find a just and generally
acceptable solution to our problem. In this connection, I am
happy to state that only yesterday I inaugurated a
high-powered Commission of Eminent Persons to look into
the circumstances leading to the annulment of the 12 June
presidential election and submit a report within 60 days.
Nigeria has always respected the purposes and
principles contained in the United Nations Charter and the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Aware that the
human person is the central subject and main beneficiary of
human rights, we fully believe that every citizen should
participate actively, within legal limits, in the realization of
these rights. We welcome the Vienna Declaration on human
rights and will, therefore, continue to be committed to the
freedom of all citizens and institutions that are engaged in
human-rights activities.
One of the sad consequences of human-rights violations
is the incidence of refugees and displaced persons - people
fleeing from insecurity to safe havens, either within or
outside their national territories. Today, several countries,
including Nigeria, cater for the needs of millions of refugees.
We urge the countries of origin of these people to create an
environment conducive to their return. This would help to
reduce the severity of the impact of refugee flows on host
nations, particularly in Africa, which are themselves faced
with excruciating economic difficulties.
Nigeria notes with great satisfaction that the situation in
the Middle East has taken a definite turn for the better. The
4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session
historic signing of the peace agreement by Israel and the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is a welcome and
important landmark. We are convinced that this will lay the
foundation for peace between Israel and the Palestinians and
will constitute an indispensable element for the peaceful
resolution of the entire Middle East problem. We again
congratulate the Government of Israel and the leadership of
the PLO, whose spirit of conciliation made the agreement a
reality. We also commend the Governments of Norway, the
United States of America and the Russian Federation for
their efforts and their encouragement and support, which
made the peace agreement possible.
The debt crisis remains the most serious obstacle to our
economic development. The various attempts of creditor
countries to address this problem have been limited in scope
and have failed adequately to deal with the debt problem of
middle-income countries. Therefore, while noting with
appreciation the relief provided under the Trinidad, Toronto
and Houston terms, we must emphasize that the fundamental
crisis in the economic development of developing countries
has not been effectively addressed. The fact that the debt of
African countries in 1992 amounted to $275 billion - about
73 per cent of the total output of the African continent -
demonstrates clearly the seriousness of the situation.
Moreover, when it is borne in mind that debt-servicing
obligations are estimated at about 30 per cent of the value of
our exports, the crippling effect on our economies becomes
apparent. We therefore propose a dialogue involving all the
parties to enable the issues to be properly addressed.
The various dimensions of Africa’s economic problems
are worth repeating, as we who are at the receiving end of
the economic dislocation of varying degrees that affects most
African countries realize the necessity of continuing to draw
our economic plight to the attention of the rest of the world.
This matter must not be regarded lightly. The African
economic crisis, as well as being a major source of the
prevailing social and political turmoil in many countries of
the region, must be seen as a serious threat to the longer-
term prospects for the global economy.
Let me be so bold as to say that the persistence of the
crisis is not due to inaction on the part of the African
Governments concerned. On the contrary - taking the
example of my country - the truth is that our determination
to face up to the challenge of development is obvious from
the policy reforms we have been implementing for nearly
seven years in order to restructure and revitalize the
economy. These reforms are already yielding some positive
results, but not of the magnitude that we regard as necessary
if there is to be a significant upturn in the economy.
It would not be far-fetched to suggest that the fact that
the economic reforms that have been put in place have
enjoyed only limited success is apparently due to lack of
adequate support from the international community to
complement our genuine efforts to revamp our respective
economies. For instance, the flow of external finance to
African countries still leaves much to be desired, despite the
efforts made in recent years by countries like mine to ensure
a climate conducive to foreign investment. We therefore
urge a change of heart on the part of our development
partners, as this will be mutually beneficial. We also call on
the United Nations system to mobilize its machinery fully so
that lingering African economic problems may be addressed
effectively.
Today, Africa faces daunting environmental problems
too. Desertification, drought, soil and marine erosion and
shortage of fresh water are new difficulties confronting the
continent. Two fifths of Africa’s land mass has turned into
desert. African countries continue to make efforts to arrest
this threat to our livelihood. However, we do not have
sufficient resources to combat the scourge. We therefore
urge the speedy conclusion of an international convention,
complete with a funding mechanism, to combat drought and
desertification.
In the aftermath of the cold war, appreciable progress
has been made in the field of disarmament. It is comforting
to note that, to a greater extent than during any other period
in recent history, significant efforts have been made by
States to achieve openness and transparency with regard to
security issues. The unilateral decision of the nuclear-
weapon States to halt nuclear testing was universally
applauded. Needless to say, therefore, we were disappointed
at the breach of the moratorium that occurred a few days
ago. We appeal once again to all nuclear-weapon States to
refrain from resuming nuclear testing and, thereby, enhance
the prospects for the non-proliferation Treaty review and
extension Conference in 1995, which will be crucial to
efforts to halt nuclear proliferation.
Since the creation of the United Nations 48 years ago,
the world in which the Organization exists has undergone
many changes. These changes are reflected in its
membership, which, since 1945, has almost quadrupled. The
distribution of power and influence in the world has
changed. The institutions of the United Nations cannot and
should not be immune to the changes. Indeed, in order to
maintain its relevance, the United Nations must reflect the
changes in its environment. We renew our call for a serious
review of some of the institutions of the Organization -
particularly the Security Council. We have always stressed
Forty-eighth session - 7 October l993 5
the need to expand the membership of the Council by the
admission of additional permanent members so that all
regions of the world would be represented. It is our hope
that negotiations on this crucial issue will be advanced
during this session of the General Assembly.
Notwithstanding the several positive developments of
the past few years, the world still faces many challenges. In
addition to the continued disruption of the peace and stability
of many States by raging internal conflicts, there are
problems that require urgent action. The spread of poverty
and the increasing imbalance between the developing and the
developed countries are two of the more spectacular of these
problems. We are convinced that correction of this
unacceptable situation is an attainable objective.
However, the solution requires a commitment by all
States to accept and vigorously practise the concept of
international cooperation. My country remains an active
partner in this cooperative endeavour to make our world
safer and more prosperous.
As we look forward to the celebration, in two years’
time, of the fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the United
Nations, there is in the air much optimism about the future
of the Organization. The new world order, if it is to fulfil
its promise, must be constructed on the solid foundation of
the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Thus,
our Organization is bound to play a central role in sustaining
a world of the sovereign equality of States; a world of
respect for fundamental human rights; a world of global
interdependence and of cooperation for development.
Let all Member States demonstrate the determination to
ensure that our world body justifies the expectations of
humanity.




1994
On behalf of the Nigerian
delegation, I wish to congratulate you, Sir, on your
election as President of the General Assembly at its
forty-ninth session. Your election is a tribute not only to
you personally and to your great country, but to Africa as
a whole. As a representative of Côte d’Ivoire, a country
with which Nigeria enjoys excellent and brotherly
relations, you have our full confidence in your ability to
successfully discharge the responsibilities of your high
office.
I wish to express our sincere appreciation to your
predecessor, Mr. Samuel Insanally of Guyana, for the
admirable and effective manner in which he conducted
the business of the forty-eighth session.
Let me also commend our esteemed
Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the
purposeful manner in which he has discharged the duties
of his office.
My Government heartily welcomes South Africa
back to the General Assembly. For decades, the policy of
apartheid kept that great country from participating in the
work of the Assembly. Happily, apartheid has now been
consigned to history. We salute all those who identified
with, and contributed to, the long struggle to eradicate
apartheid and racism in South Africa. A special tribute
must be paid to our brothers and sisters in South Africa
who were the direct victims of that evil system and who
led the struggle for its eradication.
We commend the vision and statesmanship of
President Nelson Mandela for his effective leadership in
managing so skilfully the transition of a once-divided
society to a united, non-racial, democratic nation. We
commend the courage and the untiring efforts of his
Government and the entire people of South Africa to heal
the wounds of the past and launch their country on the
path of economic growth and prosperity on a foundation
of justice and equity for all its citizens. We are confident
11


that the new South Africa will contribute positively to the
work of the United Nations.
In the last few years we have witnessed rapid and
profound changes on the international scene. Not only have
complex challenges arisen, but also new opportunities for
the United Nations to redouble its efforts and contributions
to the quest for peace and security and to build a world
characterized by cooperation and an international
community nurtured by a common concern for humanity.
It is a matter of serious concern that the peaceful
world expected to be ushered in by the end of the cold war
has not materialized. The world continues to face some of
the worst forms of conflict and new threats to international
peace and security. Violent conflicts arising from resurgent
nationalism and religious intolerance between and within
States have proliferated. The unresolved situations in
Rwanda, Liberia, Somalia, Afghanistan, Cambodia, parts of
the former Yugoslavia and parts of the former Soviet Union
have caused wanton loss of life and destruction to property
and have given rise to humanitarian crises of immense
proportions. We must find early and lasting solutions to
these conflicts, as they constitute continuing threats to
regional stability and to world peace.
Against this backdrop, the United Nations, as the focal
point of international cooperation, should seek to redefine
its role and establish new structures and mechanisms that
can respond effectively to the challenges of crisis
management and conflict resolution. The United Nations
must retain its primary responsibility for taking the lead in
addressing these problems. The Secretary-General’s
Agenda for Peace provides a novel and imaginative
framework towards this end.
In the emerging world order Africa must not continue
to remain a continent beset with crises and dependent on
others for resolution of its internal conflicts. In realization
of this, the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
established in 1993 a Central Mechanism for Conflict
Prevention, Resolution and Management. However, it is
evident that the OAU’s capacity to effectively mobilize the
required financial and logistic resources for this purpose is
severely limited. There is, therefore, a necessity for the
international community and the United Nations to
encourage, through increased financial and logistic support,
Africa’s efforts at peaceful settlements of disputes through
regional and other arrangements, in accordance with the
United Nations Charter. We urge the international
community to contribute urgently and generously to the
Africa Peace Fund, established by the Organization of
African Unity.
The capacity of the United Nations to respond
promptly and effectively to the demands made on it for
peace-keeping operations depends on the willingness of
Member States to accept that there is a primary role for
the United Nations and that they be ready to contribute
the necessary resources to enable it to fulfil such a role.
Since our admission 34 years ago, Nigeria has been an
active participant in global efforts at peace-keeping,
conflict resolution and crisis management. Our
experience over the years has convinced us that there is
a clear need to re-examine and reorient the peace-keeping
efforts of the United Nations. Since initiating in Liberia
the Economic Community of West African States Military
Observer Group (ECOMOG), a subregional peace-keeping
force, Nigeria has become Africa’s and, indeed, the
world’s largest troop contributor to international
peace-keeping operations. Even though one or two
Member States may choose not to recognize its
contribution, the records at the disposal of this
Organization will clearly show Nigeria’s significant
contribution to the shared responsibility of global peace-
keeping, with its attendant sacrifices, including loss of
Nigerian lives.
That is why we are concerned at the incessant
harassment, kidnapping and killing of peace-keeping
personnel in various theatres of conflict. As an
encouragement to other countries to participate in these
costly and often dangerous operations, the United Nations
must develop a capacity of effective deterrence against
such attacks and adopt appropriate measures to provide
prompt and adequate compensation for the victims.
One of the disturbing consequences of the
proliferation of conflicts is the increasing incidence of
refugees and displaced persons. It is our firm conviction
that Governments must create structures and suitable
conditions which will enable peoples to live in a secure
and safe environment in full enjoyment of their human
rights and fundamental freedoms. Regrettably, Africa has
the largest number of refugees and displaced persons in
the world. This imposes additional and enormous
financial, material and social burdens on the already
distressed economies of receiving States. We commend
the efforts of the international community in addressing
the refugee problems through the provision of
humanitarian assistance. We call on all Governments to
eradicate the root causes of the existence of refugees and
displaced persons and to create the appropriate conditions
12


for facilitating their voluntary return to their various
countries.
Despite the end of the cold war, nuclear weapons
continue to pose the greatest threat to international peace
and security. Consequently, the need to reduce substantially
and ultimately eliminate them must remain our primary
goal. Recent reports of a rising trend of trafficking in
nuclear materials represent a disturbing new dimension to
nuclear proliferation which must be checked as a matter of
urgency.
Next year’s review and extension conference of the
non-proliferation Treaty, which has so far served the
international community rather well, must be pursued with
vigour. The review and extension of the Treaty must be
consistent with objective reality and the basic expectations
of Member States.
Questions of peace and security are inextricably linked
to issues of development. We therefore welcome the
presentation by the Secretary-General of 'An Agenda for
Development' (A/48/935), which is a fitting complement to
his earlier proposals in 'An Agenda for Peace' (A/47/277).
In 'An Agenda for Development', the Secretary-General
has identified five strands: peace as the foundation for
development; the economy as the engine of progress; the
environment as a basis for sustainability; justice as a pillar
of society; and democracy as good governance. Nigeria
welcomes these presentations because we believe that the
people must be at the centre of all governmental activity,
including the goals of development, peace and security.
Global efforts in addressing the crisis of development
have, over the years, reflected a dichotomy of perception
between the industrialized countries of the North and the
developing countries of the South. We must recognize that
development, like peace, is indivisible. It is therefore of
vital importance that the North and the South should see
cooperation in development in terms of mutuality of interest
and partnership. The expectation that the end of the cold
war would make more resources available for development,
especially in developing countries, has regrettably remained
unfulfilled. In the circumstances, the international
community should initiate bold and imaginative measures
to bridge the widening gap between the rich and the poor
nations. Affluence in the midst of poverty provides neither
peace nor security either to the rich or to the poor.
Africa continues to face grave economic difficulties,
at the heart of which is the debt crisis. The perennial
problems of declining investment, capital flight and fall in
commodity prices remain. The response of the
international community has been feeble and rather
inadequate. The United Nations Programme of Action for
Africa’s Economic Recovery and Development
(UNPAAERD) did not achieve its desired objectives. It
does not appear that the New Agenda for Africa’s
Development in the 1990s will meet with much success
either. It is therefore imperative that Africa should be
enabled to make a fresh start to address these problems
effectively through an imaginative solution to the debt
crisis and the diversification of its economies.
For our part, we recognize the need for credible
macro-economic policies, as well as for fundamental
reforms of our political institutions and processes, and we
are taking measures in this regard. However, there is a
need to evolve new mechanisms and strategies for
international cooperation and partnership.
In the wake of the efforts made in structurally
reforming our economy and the democratizion of our
political institutions, Nigeria, like many other African
countries, has come to grips with certain realities, the
ramifications of which are usually misconstrued and need
to be fully understood.
Political pluralism, as a facet of democratization, is
so deeply ingrained in our national way of life that over
the years we have tried to evolve appropriate democratic
institutions and values arising from and responding to our
specific national experiences, circumstances and
aspirations. We remain committed to this process, which
is on course, despite its difficulties and challenges.
Too often the process of democratization in Nigeria
and, indeed, in several other parts of Africa, has not been
correctly presented to the international community.
Recent advances in information technology and our lack
of resources and capacity for information delivery have
hampered our ability to objectively project developments
occurring in our societies. For instance, in Nigeria, we
continue to make impressive progress in rebuilding
sustainable democratic structures and institutions. A
Constitutional Conference whose members were largely
elected and representing a wide spectrum of our society
and diverse interests, has been working assiduously to
create an environment conducive to mutual trust,
confidence and common purpose among our people. The
objective of the Conference is to establish appropriate
modalities, institutions and frameworks for a viable
democratic order, by laying down the ground rules for the
formation of political parties, and for conducting free and
13


fair elections at all levels of government. The
Constitutional Conference will complete its work by
November 1994. Following the progress made so far,
political activities have already commenced and full-fledged
political party activities leading to general elections will
commence early in the new year. The resolve and
commitment of the Nigerian people and Government to
democracy remain firm and unshakeable in the full
realization that the task of democratization is primarily our
responsibility and is for the good of our people.
The United Nations has no doubt distinguished itself
since its inception as an indispensable forum for
harmonizing the actions of nations. We are confident that
it will continue to serve in the years ahead as a platform for
galvanizing and channelling our collective efforts towards
lasting peace and justice. This is especially so if we look
inwards with a view to revitalizing and strengthening the
Organization itself. The Government of Nigeria endorses
the view of the Secretary-General in his report 'An Agenda
for Peace' to the effect that to meet the challenges of a new
era, the United Nations must reinforce its capacity to
respond as well as to reorient its approach to issues which
confront it. We subscribe to his recommendation that
Member States provide the necessary political commitment
and financial resources to enable the Organization to
expand, adapt and reinvigorate its work.
The reforms undertaken by our Organization so far
have been essentially piecemeal and incremental. We have
made it clear on several occasions that the time was ripe
for a fundamental restructuring of the United Nations
system. The present composition and the decision-making
process of the Security Council do not adequately reflect
current realities brought into sharp relief since the end of
the cold war. As an instrument for multilateral cooperation,
the United Nations must be transparent, efficient and
democratic.
The Security Council, as the most important organ of
the United Nations, should embody the global quest for
democratization in its structure, composition and
decision-making processes. In this regard, Nigeria attaches
particular importance to the work of the Open-Ended
Working Group on the question of equitable representation
on and increase in the membership of the Security Council.
It is our expectation that the recommendations that will
emerge will make the United Nations more responsive to
the needs of the international community. We also expect
that the criteria for permanent membership of the Council
should include such considerations as population, capacity
to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and
security, and a track record assessed over a period of time
in international peace-keeping and peacemaking efforts.
All permanent members should enjoy the same status and
privileges and assume the responsibilities incumbent on
membership. No less important is the imperative of
equitable geographical representation, which must include
permanent membership for Africa in the Security Council.
In this connection, it is appropriate that I reconfirm
Nigeria’s offer to serve the international community as a
permanent member of the Security Council.
In this last decade of the twentieth century, two
issues have preoccupied the United Nations: the
promotion of peace and security and the intensification of
international cooperation for development. On both
issues, the United Nations has responded to our collective
aspirations with varying degrees of success. As we
approach the twenty-first century, we must dedicate
ourselves anew to the full realization of these core goals
and objectives of our Organization so that mankind can
enjoy peace, freedom and prosperity.




1995

I am delighted to
address the General Assembly in the year of its fiftieth
anniversary. On behalf of the Nigerian delegation, I
convey warm congratulations to the President on his
election to preside over the General Assembly at its
fiftieth session. We are confident that in carrying out his
duties he will bring his wisdom, competence and
diplomatic skills to bear on the work of the Assembly.
We congratulate his friendly country, Portugal, and
reaffirm the warmth of the bilateral relations between our
two countries.
Let me also convey our sincere thanks to his
distinguished predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Amara
Essy of Côte d’Ivoire, for the outstanding manner in
which he conducted the affairs of the General Assembly
at its forty-ninth session. I also wish to express my
delegation’s appreciation to the Secretary-General for the
courageous manner in which he is responding to the
challenges of his office.
The uniqueness of the current session is not lost on
my delegation. It is not only a solemn occasion to reflect
on the achievements and difficulties of our Organization
during the past 50 years, but also a golden opportunity to
chart a new way forward. We therefore hope that the
work of this and future sessions of the General Assembly
will continue to be inspired by the purposes and
principles of the United Nations Charter.
The establishment of the United Nations in the
aftermath of the Second World War marked a turning
point in the history of international relations. As an
intergovernmental Organization whose principal tasks
include the maintenance of international peace and
security, the promotion of international cooperation for
7


development and the progressive development and
codification of international law and respect for human
rights, the United Nations best epitomizes the will of the
peoples of the world to live together.
We in Africa attach great importance to this fiftieth
anniversary, as in 1945 the vast majority of our countries
were not independent and therefore could not participate in
the processes leading to the signing of the United Nations
Charter in San Francisco. It is gratifying, however, that
from being represented by only four countries on that
occasion, Africa has since grown to be the largest regional
group within the Organization. This is in accordance with
the universalist aspirations of the United Nations.
The phenomenal growth in membership evokes happy
memories of the transition of a large number of Member
States, particularly from Africa and Asia, from colonial
dependencies to nationhood. For many years the United
Nations was the catalyst in this process. Our continental
organization, the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
from its inception in 1963, similarly embraced this
objective as a primary preoccupation. It was my country’s
privilege to be associated at the regional and global levels
with the struggle against apartheid and for freedom and
self-determination on the continent.
The United Nations is perhaps best known for its
endeavours in the maintenance of international peace and
security. This remains a major preoccupation, as events
since the end of the Cold War have demonstrated that civil
conflicts and political instability in many countries,
particularly in the developing world, have become endemic,
with grave consequences for international peace and
security. These conflicts, which have their origins in,
among other things, new nationalisms, ethnic differences
and religious bigotry, constitute a test of the international
community’s will to meet the new challenges and provide
appropriate solutions.
On this occasion, therefore, it is the hope of the
Nigerian delegation that the Assembly will make sustained
efforts to take decisions that will significantly enhance the
prospects of global peace and security. We expect that
further thought will be given to redefining the role of the
United Nations and its perspectives on preventive
diplomacy, peacemaking, peace-keeping and peace-building
as continuing imperatives in crisis management and conflict
resolution.
Given that the maintenance of international peace and
security is a shared responsibility, the United Nations
should undertake to realign and strengthen its cooperation
with regional organizations and arrangements. This is not
to underestimate the need for Member States to make
serious efforts to prevent war and civil conflict through
confidence-building measures and the formulation and
implementation of appropriate domestic policies. In this
regard, we cannot but reaffirm the continuing validity of
the peaceful resolution of disputes through mediation,
conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement and respect for
applicable international laws.
We deplore the growing arms race and the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, on which
vast resources are now being wasted. The nuclear genie
has left the bottle and cannot now be led back into it; the
trauma of Hiroshima and Nagasaki persists and continues
to haunt the international conscience. Let us therefore
resolve that such a tragedy will never happen again. The
time for disarmament under effective international control
is now.
Although progress towards the achievement of
general and complete disarmament has been slow, we
would like to commend the United Nations for its role in
this sphere. Nigeria regards the agreements banning
biological and chemical weapons as landmark
arrangements. We must remain committed to the ultimate
goal of the total elimination of all weapons of mass
destruction.
On its twenty-fifth anniversary, in May of this year,
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
(NPT) was extended indefinitely. Developments since
then have seriously undermined the confidence we have
all reposed in the Treaty and its regime, and have
regrettably cast major doubt on the commitment of
Member States, particularly the nuclear Member States,
to disarmament. In our view, efforts to achieve this must
remain fundamental and include the conclusion of a
comprehensive nuclear- test-ban treaty by 1996, the cut-
off in the production of fissionable materials for weapons
purposes, and the granting of security assurances by the
nuclear-weapon States to non-nuclear-weapon States in a
legally binding instrument.
In our continuing efforts to ensure a peaceful and
secure environment for the development of the African
continent, Nigeria is delighted to welcome the successful
completion of the negotiations on the Treaty of an
African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone, which was endorsed
by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Council of
Ministers in June 1995. By this action, African leaders
8


have given concrete expression to their collective
commitment to make the continent a nuclear-weapon-free
zone. It is our expectation that during this session the
international community will respect this initiative through
the endorsement of the Treaty. We hope that the nuclear-
weapon States will ratify the protocols to be annexed to the
Treaty.
The framers of the Charter of the United Nations did,
in fact, recognize that peace and development go together.
Among the high purposes of our Organization is the
promise of economic and social achievement by all peoples.
To this end, a good deal of effort has been made by the
United Nations and its agencies to support the
implementation of programmes of action initiated by
developing countries at national, subregional and regional
levels. We commend these agencies for their efforts in
tackling the problems of social and economic development.
In discussing the general issue of development, we
recognize the primacy of the United Nations in promoting
international cooperation for development. It is in this
connection that we have welcomed the contribution of the
Secretary-General in his Agenda for Development. For us
in Africa, development is a question of survival. We place
a particular premium on it as we confront the challenges of
poverty and underdevelopment.
While the unsatisfactory economic situation of Africa
has been the subject of many international conferences, the
resulting programmes of action have remained largely
unimplemented. Such programmes include the United
Nations Programme of Action for African Economic
Recovery and Development 1986-1990 and the United
Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the
1990s, adopted in 1991. The failure to implement these
programmes has been due primarily to the lack of will and
acceptance of a concept of economic interdependence by
our development partners. Yet, it remains important that
development should be seen as an integral and indivisible
whole, an objective to be pursued collectively in the global
economy.
The economic crises confronting the developing
countries are multifaceted. I would, however, like to stress
the pre-eminent need for the international community to
resolve the external-debt crisis, which is a key impediment
to growth and development in our respective countries.
Most African countries devote a large proportion of their
foreign exchange earnings to debt-servicing. It has,
therefore, been difficult for these countries to also pursue
sustained economic development objectives. It is clear that
Nigeria — as, indeed, most other countries of our
continent — faces limited possibilities for the
implementation of their economic reform programmes
without urgent and adequate debt-relief measures.
We believe that development cooperation should
engender genuine interdependence, mutual interest and
benefits in the context of global partnership. In the
expectation that the developed countries will support and
indeed assist the developing countries in their
development efforts, we call for fuller cooperation
between the two sides. The initiative to hold the Asia-
Africa Forum in Bandung, Indonesia, in December 1994,
as a follow-up to the Tokyo International Conference for
the Development of Africa, was bold and imaginative.
The conclusions and recommendations of these initiatives,
which are also critical, need to be faithfully implemented.
The integrated approach to development being
pursued by the United Nations is right and deserves to be
commended. In this regard, we welcome the outcome of
the recently concluded World Summit for Social
Development and Fourth World Conference on Women.
These conferences have helped to promote women in
development and to enhance their role in public affairs.
We acknowledge the interdependence of societies as
underscored by these conferences, and the fact that all
cultures have a contribution to make at the crossroads of
civilization and development.
While recognizing the achievements of the United
Nations, it is fit and proper, at this point, to identify also
those areas in which the Organization has not fully
realized its objectives.
On peace and security, it should be acknowledged
that the United Nations has a commendable record of
success. Since its founding, it is significant that there has
been no global war and that the end of the cold war has
enhanced the prospects for cooperation and the lessening
of tension. However, new conflicts have emerged which
have defied solution by the United Nations. It is evident
that the challenges of peacemaking, peace-keeping and
peace-building require new perspectives and commitments
from Member States. Moreover, while seeking to provide
solutions to these conflicts, the United Nations must
accept that it has a limit to its capacity. It should,
therefore, not micromanage the internal political
arrangements of countries in conflict. It is equally
important that the United Nations be seen to be
transparent and even-handed in crisis management in all
regions. Furthermore, the United Nations should do more
9


to cultivate and cooperate with regional organizations and
arrangements in conflict resolution.
On decolonization, the balance sheet of the United
Nations performance is largely positive. However, the
legacies of colonialism and the challenges of nation-
building have created difficulties for new States. These
difficulties have resulted in the inability of many of the new
States of the developing world to conduct their domestic
and external relations in a manner consistent with the
provisions of the Charter. The experience of a number of
these States indicates that powerful members of the
international community continue to insist on their models
as standards for universal behaviour and application. The
political and economic lives of the new States are further
circumscribed by international financial institutions
dominated by the economically strong. These institutions,
which are as old as our Organization, have yet to adapt to
the new economic realities and needs of the new States
they seek to serve.
With regard to development, the objectives of the
Charter have remained largely unfulfilled in view of the
growing economic disparities between a minority of
developed countries and the vast majority of countries
which are classified as developing. Regrettably, dialogue
between the North and the South, which is vital to
effectively address this imbalance, has reached a deadlock.
This dialogue needs to be relaunched in order to achieve a
just and equitable world order for sustainable development.
Since joining the United Nations 35 years ago, Nigeria
has played its part in upholding the purposes and principles
set forth in the United Nations Charter. It has also pursued
its objectives with dedication and commitment. From
decolonization to peace-keeping, we have spared neither
efforts nor resources in fulfilling our obligations under the
Charter. Our record in peace-keeping speaks for itself.
Within the ambit of South-South cooperation, Nigeria
has extended assistance to other developing countries,
particularly in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. In our
subregion, we are in active partnership with the countries
of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) to accelerate development through cooperation.
It is our hope that ECOWAS will become an essential
component for continental integration as envisaged under
the Abuja Treaty on the African Economic Community.
To avoid any doubt, I wish to state that we in Africa
have long accepted that the primary responsibility for the
development of our continent rests squarely on our
shoulders. But the reality of our experience is that we
have had to fight on the two fronts of political and
economic reforms at the same time. Few regions of the
world have borne such excruciating burdens in their
development process. This calls for understanding and
encouragement rather than indifference and benign
neglect. Consequently, in addition to regional integration
efforts, we in Nigeria have undertaken bold economic and
political reforms. On the economic front, the current
Administration in Nigeria has deregulated the economy
and created new incentives for domestic and foreign
investments.
On the political plane, Nigeria has embarked on
courageous reforms. In spite of unforeseen difficulties and
the complexities of the Nigerian situation, we have
continued to make steady progress in our determined
efforts to establish a veritable and enduring democratic
polity. Indeed, only three days ago my Head of State,
General Sani Abacha, announced a comprehensive
programme of transition to democratic rule and the final
disengagement of the military from power. This
programme was carefully drawn up taking into account
the objective realities of our national situation to ensure
not only an orderly transition, but also the
institutionalization of durable democratic structures of
governance at all levels.
While we recognize and appreciate the
understandable concerns of our foreign friends and the
international community at large, we hope that due
support will be given to our endeavour in the full
realization that a democratic Nigeria, the most populous
black nation on Earth, is an asset to itself and has much
to offer the international community.
In order that the United Nations might be better
equipped to discharge its responsibility as a forum for
harmonizing the actions of nations, it is essential that the
ongoing process of revitalization and institutional reforms
be intensified. This is necessary if the United Nations is
to assert its central role in the establishment of a new
world order. It is also vital if the United Nations is to
truly reflect the equity and geographical balance that are
critical for its efficiency and authority.
Nigeria, therefore, reaffirms its support for the
expansion of the Security Council both in its permanent
and in its non-permanent membership and, in this
connection, my delegation renews the offer made by our
country to serve the international community as a
permanent member in the expanded Security Council.
10


As we look to the future, it is obvious that the
effectiveness of the United Nations will depend on the
collective will and support of its entire membership. There
are two levels of responsibility in ensuring a strong and
vibrant United Nations. The first is what the United Nations
itself must do; the second, and more important, is what we
the Member States accept to do to enable the Organization
to respond effectively to our collective quest for peace,
freedom, justice and development. In pursuit of these
objectives, Nigeria is determined to continue making its
contributions.



1996



On behalf of the Nigerian
delegation, I convey to Mr. Razali Ismail our
congratulations on his election as President of the General
Assembly at its fifty-first session. His election is a
recognition of his wide-ranging experience, candour and
diplomatic skills. It is also a tribute to his great country.
We are confident that, under his presidency, the work of
the General Assembly will be highly successful.
May I also convey the appreciation of my delegation
to his predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas Do Amaral of
Portugal, for the admirable manner and great sense of
commitment with which he conducted the affairs of the
fiftieth session of the Assembly. Nigeria also commends
Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for the energy, sense of
purpose and direction which he has brought to bear on the
office of the Secretary-General in the meritorious service
of our Organization.
When we met last year to commemorate the fiftieth
anniversary of the United Nations, we observed that a
number of developments on the political and economic
scene had affected relations between States and modified
the configuration of power at the global level. We
9


recognized that the United Nations continues to be a viable
instrument for the conduct of relations amongst States. We
rededicated ourselves to the principles and objectives of the
United Nations Charter, including, in particular, the
promotion of social and economic development and the
maintenance of international peace and security. In this
endeavour, the United Nations has a central role to play.
Member States, in line with their obligations under the
Charter, have a duty to assist the United Nations in carrying
out this responsibility. This requires the political
commitment of all Member States and in particular of those
upon which the Charter confers special status.
Some of the developments which have occurred on the
international scene include the globalization of the world
economy, the upsurge in market economies, the rise in
economic growth in a number of countries and the growing
trend towards political pluralism and democratization.
However, new forms of conflict, new nationalisms,
terrorism, an increasing incidence of poverty and global
social decline have cast a sombre shadow on international
peace and security, as well as on economic growth and
development. The growing incidents of conflict, whether in
Europe, in Africa or in the Middle East, and the slow pace
of their resolution, are helping to exacerbate international
tension and undermine confidence among States. The
United Nations has a duty in this regard to redefine its role
and sharpen its peacemaking and peacekeeping tools in
order to effectively address them.
Peace is indivisible. The burden of peace, therefore,
should be shared by all in a mode of global responsibility
and partnership. Let me add also that the maintenance of
international peace and security is not an exclusive
responsibility of the United Nations. Regional and
subregional arrangements have important roles to play and
have demonstrated their commitment.
Although many regions of the world are now
witnessing one form of conflict or another, with varying
degrees of implications for the United Nations system, no
region perhaps is more afflicted by this menace than Africa,
both in the number of conflicts currently raging and in their
unimaginable negative effects on the people. The individual
and collective efforts of African States to achieve socio-
political transformation have been threatened by these
conflicts. In spite of this, the States of Africa have
continued to make concerted efforts at regional and
subregional levels to address this situation. The unique role
being played by the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
Mechanism for Conflict Prevention Management and
Resolution is important and should be supported by the
international community. Nigeria welcomes the
cooperation between the OAU and other regional
organizations and the United Nations in the field of
preventive diplomacy, peacekeeping and peacemaking.
In our own subregion, the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) undertook an
unprecedented initiative in crisis management by
establishing a peacekeeping force, the ECOWAS
Monitoring Group (ECOMOG), in Liberia six years ago.
In spite of the difficulties we have encountered in the
process, we remain committed in our endeavour to help
the Liberian process reach its logical conclusion. In this
regard, Nigeria shares the view of many observers who
have described the revised Abuja peace agreement of
August 1996 as providing the best legal framework for
the resolution of the Liberian crisis. I am pleased to
report that the implementation of the Agreement revised
at Abuja last August is now on course. A new Council of
State, headed by Mrs. Ruth Perry, has been installed.
Since her installation, Mrs. Perry has enjoyed the
considerable confidence of the other members of the
Liberian National Transitional Government and indeed of
most Liberians. I take this opportunity to appeal to all
Liberians to extend cooperation to the new leadership in
the interest of peace in their country. Let me assure the
Assembly that it is the determination of my Head of
State, General Sani Abacha, Chairman of ECOWAS —
in collaboration with other leaders in our region and with
the support of the international community as a whole —
to ensure the resolution of the Liberian crisis.
It is our expectation that the Liberians themselves
will assume their destiny in favour of peace, national
reconciliation and national reconstruction. We therefore
renew our appeal to the international community to
provide much-needed financial, material and logistic
support to enable ECOMOG and the United Nations
Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) to effectively
discharge their respective mandates. Meanwhile, we
acknowledge with appreciation the renewed cooperation
and assistance with the ECOWAS effort of some of the
members of the international community.
Of great importance to the search for peace in the
various troubled spots of the world is the urgent need to
control the instruments of war. It is a matter of deep
regret that the end of the cold war has not ushered in in
its wake any appreciable reduction in the global arms
build-up. As the arms build-up and the proliferation of
conflicts are mutually reinforcing, there is an urgent need
for the international community to contain the trend. The
10


threat posed by existing stockpiles of weapons of mass
destruction and conventional armaments is yet to be
removed.
The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT),
a priority item on the disarmament agenda of the United
Nations, has been adopted. In spite of the imperfections of
this Treaty, the Nigerian Government was able to support
it and will be signing it in due course. Its adoption, which
puts an end to the further qualitative improvement of
nuclear weapons and arsenals, represents a significant first
step towards the goal of nuclear disarmament. It is our
expectation that the Conference on Disarmament, the single
multilateral negotiating body on disarmament, will now take
the next logical step to negotiate such disarmament within
a time-bound framework. The nuclear-weapon States have
a clear responsibility and duty to cooperate with the
Conference on Disarmament to negotiate such a treaty.
The adoption of the Treaty of Pelindaba creating a
nuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa has been an important
contribution to confidence building in Africa, in addition to
being a collateral disarmament measure. In view of the
overwhelming support enjoyed by the Treaty beyond the
African continent, it is recommended that other regions
undertake similar efforts by establishing nuclear-weapon-
free zones or zones of peace. While it is commendable to
observe that the majority of nuclear-weapon States have
since signed the protocol to the Treaty, we take this
opportunity to urge other States that have not yet done so
to do so, in order that the full objectives of the Treaty can
be achieved.
Peace and development are mutually reinforcing. A
just and enduring peace can only be founded on the general
welfare and socio-economic progress of all peoples and all
nations. It is indeed disconcerting to note that while the
countries of the North are becoming more affluent, the
countries of the South, which contain the majority of the
world’s population, are getting more impoverished. We
must collectively recognize and accept the fact that the
deepening crisis of development faced by developing
countries can only undermine the new world order which
we seek to create.
Africa, in particular, has continued to experience the
crippling impacts of external debt, deteriorating terms of
trade, increasing barriers to trade, declining investment and
financial inflows, and capital flight. African countries
recognize that the primary responsibility for finding a
solution to the economic difficulties facing the continent
lies with themselves. Hence they have sought to put in
place sound macro-economic policies and adopted very
painful programmes of economic reform. However, their
best endeavours have continued to be constrained by the
prevailing unfavourable international economic climate.
We believe that development cooperation should engender
genuine interdependence, mutual interest and benefits in
the context of global partnership, rather than the old mode
of a donor-recipient relationship.
We must recognize the central role of the United
Nations in engendering the process of global
development. In this regard, my delegation calls for faster
progress in the ongoing work on the Secretary-General’s
Agenda for Development. In the same spirit, we of the
African continent urge the international community to
deliver on its promises under the United Nations New
Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s (UN-
NADAF). We have just taken part in the mid-term review
of its implementation. We recognize that UN-NADAF has
had a poor record of implementation. None the less, the
United Nations system and the international community
at large must deliver on their various commitments.
Nigeria considers as complementary the Secretary-
General’s United Nations System-wide Special Initiative
for Africa, particularly as it envisages collaboration and
coordination of efforts between the international
community, the Bretton Woods financial institutions and
the United Nations development agencies on the issue of
development. In recognition of its role as the centre for
the harmonization of the actions of nations, the United
Nations successful hosting of major global conferences on
development — from New York in 1990 through Rio in
1992, Vienna in 1993, Cairo in 1994, Copenhagen and
Beijing in 1995, to Istanbul in 1996 — deserves our
special commendation. The faithful implementation of the
decisions and programmes of action of these conferences
would assist in bridging the yawning gap between the
developing and the developed economies and constitute a
substantive benefit to development. Accordingly, we
endorse and will continue to give our unqualified support
to the hosting of a special session of the General
Assembly in 1997 to review the implementation of
Agenda 21.
It is hardly necessary to recall that contemporary
international relations were founded on the basis of
respect for the principles of sovereign equality of States,
non-interference in the internal affairs of other States and
peaceful co-existence. It is therefore a matter of great
concern that these hallowed principles are increasingly
being eroded by some powerful States. The United



Nations should serve as the bulwark against the imposition
of the will of the strong over that of the weak.
Today all countries are engaged in a universal quest
for human dignity. It is no longer sufficient for us to be
content that our nations have been liberated from
oppression and foreign domination. It is now universally
acknowledged that the full meaning of national sovereignty
cannot be realized unless the individual citizen is free to
exercise his true conscience. The rise of this new
international conscience is a legitimate extension of the
earlier emergence of the new international morality which
threw colonialism into disarray.
There ought to be no conflict between national
sovereignty and the fundamental rights of the individual.
We welcome the growing international concern with human
rights, but unless we are careful to strictly define the
parameters of what actions justly constitute human rights
and what are excesses threatening the security of the State
as well as the safety and well-being of the citizens, we
could unwittingly be doing a disservice to the essence of
human freedom and dignity. We must therefore guard
against the use of human rights as a pretext for advancing
the individual or collective interests of one section of the
international community against those of the other.
In today’s world, the collation, delivery and
management of information has become an essential
component of development. Countries which are better
endowed technologically have tended to use that
endowment to the disadvantage of the less endowed. There
is a need therefore to establish a New World Information
Order, which respects the mutual sensitivities of States and
protects the values of their differing cultures.
Most developing countries lack the resources and
technological capacity for the requisite information delivery.
This, in no small measure, constrains their ability to project
news of events in their society promptly and effectively,
avoiding the tendentious reporting of the media in the
developed countries. Nigeria’s desire to be friends with all
nations, our commitment to the maintenance of international
peace and security and our abiding faith in the principles
enshrined in the charters of the United Nations, the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) and our subregional
organization, ECOWAS, are demonstrable and beyond
question. It was therefore a matter of surprise to the
Nigerian Government that this Assembly, in December
1995, adopted resolution 50/199 of 22 December 1995 on
the human-rights situation in our country. We believe that
this action was based largely on media reporting and
without any investigation of the facts of the matter. In
spite of the fact that the Nigerian Government was not
happy with that action, we subsequently took the initiative
to invite the Secretary-General to send a fact-finding
mission to Nigeria to ascertain the realities on the ground.
That mission visited the country from 28 March to 13
April 1996, and conducted its work unfettered. While the
mission’s report identified areas of progress in our
domestic situation, it also made constructive
recommendations. I would like to take this opportunity to
express the appreciation of the Government and the
people of Nigeria to those Governments which took a
principled position of not supporting the resolution against
us. We note with satisfaction that since the United
Nations visit, a growing number of countries have
reconsidered their position on the matter in favour of
Nigeria. We therefore urge the Assembly to take
cognizance of these positive developments.
The present Administration in my country has
continued to make steady progress in the implementation
of its programme of transition to democratic rule. The
fundamental difficulties which faced our nation in its
previous efforts at building a viable democracy are being
progressively addressed, taking into account the objective
realities of our national situation, so as to ensure an
orderly transition and the establishment of durable
democratic structures of governance at all levels in our
country. We are encouraged by the successful outcome of
the elections which were conducted at the local
government level in March this year. The impressive
turnout of voters nationwide and the general atmosphere
of tranquillity prevailing in our country have elicited
goodwill and support from within and outside the country.
Political parties have now been registered and full
political activities have resumed nation-wide. Our
transition to civil rule is now fully on an irreversible
course.
In our resolve to ensure that the evolving democratic
institutions take root in a fertile economic environment,
the Nigerian Government has undertaken economic
reforms aimed at promoting rapid growth and sustainable
development. The overall macroeconomic performance of
the economy has improved with the implementation of
deflationary fiscal and monetary measures. Efforts are
ongoing to establish a conducive environment for the
promotion of investment, both domestic and foreign.
Additionally, in recognition of the vital role of finance in
the attainment of greater economic efficiency, a wholesale
overhaul of the banking and financial services sector has
been undertaken to sanitize this important sector of the
12


national economy. It is also worthy of mention that
necessary instruments have been put in place in order to
intensify economic deregulation and create a conducive
environment for domestic and foreign investment.
In the year 2010, Nigeria will be 50 years old as an
independent and sovereign nation. It is envisaged that by
that date, Nigeria will have achieved economic prosperity,
political stability and social harmony. In order to realize
this objective, our Government announced, a few weeks
ago, a new socio-economic campaign, “Vision 2010”, to
provide insights into and articulate the goals and objectives
of our national economy in a macroeconomic format. It is
also intended to focus on the contribution of the private
sector as the engine of growth of our economy. We urge
the international community to give this programme the
necessary support and encouragement.
In order for the United Nations to respond fully to the
purpose for which it was established, there is need to
strengthen the Organization and to reform its principal
organs. Such reform must be system-wide and must be
undertaken not for its own sake but to achieve efficiency
and effectiveness. It should aim to enhance rather than
weaken the capacity of the United Nations to respond
effectively to the legitimate aspirations of all its Members.
A vibrant and responsible United Nations requires an
assured financial base. The failure or unwillingness of
Member States to pay their assessed contributions as and
when due is a dereliction of Charter obligations and a threat
to the survival of the United Nations. For our part, Nigeria
has continued to pay in full and without conditions our
assessed contributions to the regular budget including, in
particular, for the year 1996. We therefore call on all
Member States that have yet to do so to pay their assessed
contributions promptly, in full and without conditions.
For several decades, the Middle East question has
engaged the attention of the international community.
Nigeria has been concerned with the various wars and acts
of terrorism which have brought incalculable loss of life
and property to that region. There can be no question but
that we will continue to support the just struggle of the
Palestinian people for their inalienable right to a homeland.
There is an increasing awareness, even among the countries
of the region, that the right of Israel to live within safe and
secure borders can no longer be denied. We call on all
parties to intensify their efforts to ensure that the peace
process in the Middle East remains on course.
For some time now, the world has been faced with
a new upsurge in terrorist incidents. Nigeria condemns
unreservedly all acts of terrorism in all its manifestations,
as terrorism cannot be a substitute for dialogue and
peaceful negotiations in resolving conflicts and
misunderstandings between nations. We call on the
General Assembly to take additional steps to eradicate the
scourge of this menace, which also constitutes a threat to
international peace and security.
As the principal organ of the United Nations, the
Security Council is in dire need of reform. Its
composition must reflect the principle of equity, balance
and equitable geographical distribution. It must seek to
correct the current anomaly of the non-representation of
Africa in the permanent membership category.
We should, however, be mindful that reform of the
United Nations, particularly in a period of transition, is an
onerous undertaking. My delegation recognizes the vital
role of the office of the Secretary-General in overseeing
this reform process. In spite of the difficulties the United
Nations is passing through and the fluidity of the
international situation, His Excellency Mr. Boutros
Boutros-Ghali has shown uncommon and unrelenting
commitment to meeting the challenges of his office. He
deserves our gratitude and continued support. We
therefore wish to see him complete the laudable changes
he has initiated, some of which are already yielding
useful results. In this connection we reiterate and support
fully the collective African position that Africa should be
given the opportunity to serve two terms in the office of
Secretary-General. For that purpose, Mr. Boutros Boutros-
Ghali is the only candidate recommended by the
Organization of African Unity. Like his predecessors,
Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali should be given a second term
to serve our Organization. It is the only credible thing to
do. This is a matter of principle in our country.
My delegation recognizes the enormous tasks facing
the Organization as it seeks to concretely address the
challenges of the twenty-first century, and we wish to
reaffirm Nigeria’s commitment to continue to contribute
effectively to the realization of the Organization’s twin
objectives of global peace and prosperity.




1997


There is an overwhelming air
of expectancy across the world as we gather at this fifty-
second session of the General Assembly. It is hoped that
the events of this session over the next few weeks will
present a new vision for our Organization. The success of
this session will depend upon Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, the
Foreign Minister of Ukraine and current President of this
Assembly. His reputation for excellence and hard work
assures us all that under his presidency, the affairs of this
session will be well ordered.
May I therefore take this opportunity, on behalf of
my Head of State, General Sani Abacha, and the
Government and the people of Nigeria, to extend to him
our congratulations on his election. Let me also avail
myself of this opportunity to extend to his predecessor,
Ambassador Razali of Malaysia, our praises and high
esteem for the purposeful and dynamic leadership he gave
to the General Assembly during the past year.
My delegation notes with satisfaction the excellent
manner in which our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,
has settled down to his onerous tasks and conducted the
affairs of our Organization since he took office. He has
demonstrated through his reform proposals his capacity to
lead the United Nations into the twenty-first century. We
will continue to extend to him our fullest cooperation and
support.
As we gather here to contemplate the present state
of our world, it is tempting to be optimistic that the
United Nations will provide a solution to the problems of
nations. The truth however, is that all around the world
lies evidence of the Organization’s unfinished tasks, and
even of some of its failures to meet mankind’s hopes and
aspirations. Nonetheless, the fact that Member States
continue to participate in the annual sessions of the
General Assembly signifies that the search for peace and
the pursuit of development are indeed ongoing processes.
There still subsists an abiding faith in the United Nations
and the willingness on the part of all of us to continue to
strive for a better and more peaceful world.
That is why many nations have come here from time
to time seeking understanding for their individual travails,
believing passionately that here they would find
accommodation and support. Many of them have returned
home disappointed, confounded by the realities of today’s
world, as they come to terms with the awesome power
wielded by the strong against the weak. We must remain
mindful that international relations represent a complex
mix of national circumstances and the demands and
dictates of a changing external environment. International
relations must be based on a perceived goal of the
common good, on mutual respect for sovereignty and on
accommodation and consideration for national
circumstances and sensitivities. The United Nations must
therefore continue to serve as the bulwark against the
imposition of the will of the strong on that of the weak.
23


No nation ever addresses this body without a point of
view peculiarly its own. We all come here with our
histories, our cultures and our traditions, which give
meaning and substance to the values we seek to impart to
this Organization. In the case of my country, Nigeria, we
have the added burden of manifest destiny. While we did
not choose our destiny, we welcome its concomitant
obligations and opportunities. For it is destiny, not national
ambition, that motivates us in the discharge of our
responsibilities.
In this regard, we see in the predicament of each
troubled African State a mirror image of ourselves and a
call to duty to render assistance in the best tradition of
African brotherhood. Our exertions on behalf of regional
and subregional peace and security arise from the
circumstances of our history as the largest black nation on
earth and the fortunate circumstances of our bountiful
endowment. It is our destiny that we are home to one of
every four Africans and one of every five blacks on earth.
How could we be indifferent to the plight of the black race?
It is our unshakeable destiny to champion the promotion
and defence of the rights of all black people in Africa and
in the diaspora. So, let no one imagine that we have only
just embraced our peacekeeping role, because, as is well
known, we nurse no expansionist or hegemonistic interests.
We simply cannot be indifferent to the plight of our
brothers in other African States when their lives are
imperilled.
Since our admission to the United Nations on 7
October 1960, we have given a firm indication of our
country’s determination to chart an independent course in
world affairs and also to resolutely defend the interests of
Africa. When, for example, an atomic device was detonated
in the Sahara in 1960, Nigeria did not hesitate to express its
disapproval by breaking diplomatic relations with the
country concerned. Furthermore, we are proud to have been
part of the effort that brought about the formation of the
Organization of African Unity in 1963. We have since
spared no effort to ensure the survival of that continental
Organization. We were also in the vanguard of the struggle
for the total liberation of Africa from colonial domination
and of the campaign to eradicate apartheid in South Africa.
We regarded the apartheid system as an affront to the
dignity of the black race.
Similarly, our contributions to United Nations
peacekeeping operations span nearly three and a half
decades. Starting with the Congo in 1960, we have
committed in excess of a quarter of a million troops to
United Nations peacekeeping efforts. They have been
variously deployed to preserve peace and security in our
own region and elsewhere around the globe including in
Bosnia, Cambodia and Lebanon.
At the inception of our Organization over half a
century ago, its founding fathers captured, in the preamble
to the Charter, a vision and an expectation of saving
succeeding generations from the scourge of war. It was
hoped that a global order would emerge in which
humanity would live at peace with itself and nations
would be able to cooperate in furtherance of peace and
security. In spite of the end of the cold war, which for
many years was perceived as the main obstacle to the
realization of United Nations goals, our world is still
largely unsafe, insecure and unstable.
The threat of nuclear war still truly exists. This
makes it imperative that the total elimination of nuclear
weapons remains a priority item on the United Nations
agenda. Over and above the threat posed by nuclear
weapons, there has been a proliferation of inter-State and
intra-State conflicts with attendant negative consequences
for global peace and security. In Central Europe, Asia and
in our continent, Africa, these conflicts have devastated
societies, resulting in millions of refugees and displaced
persons. Africa is the area worst affected by these
conflicts.
The United Nations has primary responsibility for
the maintenance of international peace and security.
However, it also recognizes the crucial role which
regional and subregional organizations may play in the
realization of these objectives. It was in the light of this
recognition that the 16 countries of the West African
subregion launched, in 1990, the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS) Monitoring Group
(ECOMOG) to address the conflict in Liberia, which at
the time was rightly perceived as a threat not only to the
corporate existence of a Member State but, indeed, to
peace and security in the entire subregion.
As a result of the firm resolve of the leaders of
ECOWAS and the determination of ECOMOG, coupled
with the enhanced material and logistic support received
from friendly countries within and outside the subregion,
the disarmament of the warring factions was successfully
accomplished as scheduled, on 31 January 1997. An
environment of peace and security was then established
throughout Liberia. It then became possible for free and
fair legislative and presidential elections to be held as
scheduled, on 19 July 1997. On 2 August this year, His
Excellency Mr. Charles Ghankay Taylor was installed as
24


President of Liberia. That event brought to an end a sad
chapter in the history of Liberia. As Nigeria is currently
chairing ECOWAS, we take this opportunity to convey to
the international community our profound appreciation for
its support and assistance in bringing the Liberian conflict
to a successful end.
It is ironic that as peace came to Liberia events in
neighbouring Sierra Leone took a turn for the worse,
following the violent overthrow of the legitimate
Government of President Tejan Kabbah by a section of that
country’s military on 25 May 1997. That action was
characterized by massive looting and wanton destruction of
lives and property. Vital national assets, including the
Central Bank, were looted and burnt down. Virtually all
embassies and residences were either looted or vandalized
by the ravaging group of coup plotters now in Freetown.
All diplomatic missions have since evacuated Sierra Leone.
These developments have been roundly condemned by
the OAU, the United Nations and the international
community. It is encouraging that no foreign Government
or organization has to date given recognition or support to
the regime in Freetown. We urge that this position be
maintained.
Meanwhile, ECOWAS has spared no effort in seeking
a peaceful resolution of the problem created in Sierra
Leone. At Conakry, in June 1997, ECOWAS objectives
were defined to include: first, the early reinstatement of the
legitimate Government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah;
secondly, the return of peace and security; and, thirdly, the
resolution of the issues of refugees and displaced persons.
Accordingly, ECOWAS adopted a combination of three
strategies, namely dialogue and negotiations, sanctions and
embargo, and the possible use of force. A mechanism to
monitor and implement the ECOWAS response to the
situation in Sierra Leone was established, comprising four
countries: Nigeria, Guinea, Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana.
During the last ECOWAS summit, held recently at Abuja,
the committee was expanded to five with the addition of
Liberia, and was raised to the status of Heads of State.
At that same summit, additional measures were
imposed on the illegal regime in order to strengthen the
negotiation process towards the peaceful resolution of the
crisis in Sierra Leone. ECOMOG was mandated to oversee
the implementation of these measures. In pursuing this goal
of the peaceful resolution of the Sierra Leone crisis, we
seek the support of the international community.
Africa has of late witnessed a series of inter-State
conflicts which have in some cases led either to the
disintegration of some countries or to the total collapse of
central government authority. Consequently, many well-
meaning members of the international community have
tried to propose solutions for prevention and resolution of
conflicts in Africa. Regrettably, these various initiatives
have not only been made outside the framework of the
United Nations, but, more seriously, have tended to ignore
the existing framework and mechanisms within the
African continent. Yet it is obvious that the existing
mechanisms at both the subregional and the continental
levels have demonstrated a proven capacity to resolve
African problems. ECOWAS, the Southern African
Development Community and the Intergovernmental
Authority on Development have all established a
reputation as viable instruments for conflict resolution. Of
course, most of the regional and subregional bodies
require material and logistical support from the United
Nations as well as from individual members of the
international community.
Nigeria believes that no initiative, however well
intentioned, can succeed in resolving conflicts if it is not
discussed and adopted within the framework of the OAU
Central Organ’s Mechanism for Conflict Prevention,
Management and Resolution. Accordingly, we recommend
that all current initiatives should be first channelled
through the existing organs of the OAU.
It is our view that national sovereignty and the
fundamental rights of the individual are not necessarily
mutually exclusive, provided a proper balance is struck.
Indeed, they can be mutually reinforcing. The problem
arises when, either deliberately or inadvertently, the
prerogative of sovereignty is made subject to the absolute
rights of the individual. This is a disservice both to the
cause of freedom and to the true purpose of democracy.
What is required in the interest both of the State and of
the enhancement of human rights is a proper recognition
that the right of the individual only begins at the point
where the sovereign right of the State terminates. We
must resist the attempt in some quarters to use human
rights as a ploy to engage in activities designed to
undermine the sovereignty of some Member States in the
United Nations family.
Two years ago, the present Administration in my
country announced a programme of return to civil rule.
Since then, commendable progress has been made in the
implementation of that programme. We are encouraged by
the successful outcome of the elections held so far and of
25


the processes which we have undertaken to ensure a
successful transition. The rest of the programme is firmly
on course. We remain firmly confident that all the
processes entailed in the transition programme will be
completed on schedule, by 1 October 1998.
We have always given due recognition and
appreciation to all friendly countries in the international
system which have shown genuine concern for and
understanding of the complexities of the Nigerian situation.
After all, in 1960 we as a country willingly embraced the
Westminster model of Government put in place by the
departing colonial Power. That system took little or no
account of our traditional institutions, or indeed of our
customs and cultures. Indeed, that system collapsed after
six years. In 1979, my country, being more adventurous,
looked far across the Atlantic Ocean and adopted the
presidential system of government. However, the cost of
running the system placed a huge burden on our country’s
economy. Not surprisingly, that system too collapsed after
five years.
Today, no one can blame us as a country for searching
for a system of government best suited for Nigeria, a
system which takes into account the realities of our nation.
You may call it by whatever name, but the peace, stability,
development and good governance of our people remains
uppermost in our minds.
At 37, Nigeria is by all standards a relatively young
nation. Even those countries that have been nations for
centuries and have inherited relatively stable societies are
still grappling with the complexities of nationhood and
experimenting with new formulas to cope with the
exigencies of state. They were not present when their
forefathers, who also fought bitter civil wars, struggled to
hand them their present inheritance. They should therefore
show greater understanding for those of us engaged at this
time in the arduous task of forging new and stable societies
from the ruins of colonialism.
If Nigeria appears concerned and indeed preoccupied
with the vital issues of peace and stability at home, in West
Africa and in Africa as a whole, it is because we are
convinced that the urgent demands of socio-economic
development cannot be effectively tackled without peace
and stability. Nigeria believes that peace and stability in
Africa will facilitate the channelling of our limited
resources into the critical areas of political, social and
economic development. Consequently, since the end of our
civil war in 1970, we have embarked on a deliberate and
substantial reduction of the Nigerian armed forces from a
strength of 500,000 in all ranks to the barely 100,000 that
it is today. This has resulted in a corresponding reduction
in military expenditure.
Security considerations have sometimes compelled
countries to allocate a disproportionate share of their
national budgets to military expenditure. This has had the
effect of reducing resources available for development.
The end of the cold war had raised hopes that substantial
resources would be available in the form of a peace
dividend for development. Unfortunately, the proliferation
of regional conflicts and civil wars has led even the
United Nations into allocating enormous resources for
peacekeeping and conflict resolution, thus weakening its
capacity to fulfil its Charter obligations regarding social
and economic development.
Since its establishment 52 years ago, the United
Nations has served as an instrument for implementing a
global agenda of a diverse, complex and pressing nature.
As has been evident from the debates that have taken
place in the General Assembly, no one today can deny the
need for and the urgency of reform.
In this regard, the Secretary-General has now made
a number of proposals, in addition to the ongoing efforts
of the General Assembly on the subject of reform. My
delegation will actively participate in the consideration of
these proposals. In doing so, it is important to stress that
the outcome should encompass and take on board the
views and interests of all Member States.
The reforms of the United Nations, as proposed for
the Secretariat, the General Assembly and the specialized
agencies, would be incomplete without a corresponding
reform of the Security Council. A reform of the Council
would entail a restructuring and expansion of its
membership in both categories to take account of, among
other things, the increased membership of our
Organization and the need to reflect the interests of all the
constituent regions.
Happily, there is now broad agreement on the need
for the expansion of the membership of the Security
Council in both categories. With almost a third of the
membership of the United Nations, Africa should have
adequate representation in an expanded Security Council.
At the thirty-third summit of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) held in Harare, Zimbabwe, last June,
leaders of Africa reaffirmed the need for the region to
have two permanent seats with full veto powers. Nigeria
considers this demand legitimate and well deserved.
26


We stand here today as guardians of the heritage of
our cherished Organization, even as we gaze at the future
horizon and the dawning of the new millennium. The vision
we harbour about the future of the United Nations is
inevitably conditioned by the objective realities of the
present and the vigour with which we shall pursue the
hopes and challenges of the new millennium.
It is within our means and our grasp to make the next
50 years of the United Nations different, more exciting and
generally more beneficial to the world at large. We can
plead no alibi or extenuating circumstances should we fail
to do so. For, unlike in San Francisco, when nearly two
thirds of the present membership of the United Nations did
not participate in the creation of the bold new world, this
time around, we, all 185 nations at the United Nations, are
the world, and we are present at the reordering of the new
international world order, as envisaged by the reform
proposals of the United Nations and its organs. We should
take the opportunity to establish a revamped United
Nations of shared values and interests and to promote a
greater equality of States.
Students of history will bear testimony to the fact
that over the centuries, centres of power and influence
have shifted constantly from one part of the world to
another. The rise and fall of great empires has been a
constant phenomenon in human history. A gale wind of
change is now blowing across the globe. My country,
Nigeria, identifies with that change, which inevitably will
result in new centres of power and influence. It is not to
be imagined that any one continent will forever remain at
the periphery of the emerging new world order.
The millennium bell tolls for the nations of the
world as we await the dawning of the new age. We must
not shirk our responsibility for the regeneration of the
United Nations. We are the world. Let us, from this
historic Hall, reaffirm our faith in humankind. Let our
dream come true for a new and vibrant inner vision that
will light our paths into the next century. Now is the
time; as the late Mother Teresa so gently reminded us,
“Tomorrow has not yet come, yesterday is
already gone, and we have only today — let us
begin”.






1998

I bring greetings, Sir, from the
Government and the people of Nigeria, on whose behalf I
am honoured and privileged to address this fifty-third
session of the General Assembly, which is taking place
under your presidency. Your election to the presidency is
an expression of the confidence which Member States
repose in you and a measure of our faith in your capacity
to bring to bear on the work of the Assembly your wisdom,
competence and diplomatic skills. I congratulate you most
warmly on your election and also wish you a very
successful tenure.
My delegation would also like to pay tribute to your
predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine, for the
excellent manner in which he conducted the affairs of the
fifty-second session.
We also take this opportunity to express our
immense satisfaction with the way Secretary-General Kofi
Annan has steered the affairs of our Organization. We
wish to assure him of our fullest support and cooperation
as he leads our Organization into the twenty-first century.
The United Nations represents the will of all
mankind to collectively seek solutions to the common
problems facing our world. It demonstrates the ingenuity
of the human spirit to assemble the diverse peoples of the
world in a collaborative effort to attain the goals of
international peace and security, promotion of socio-
economic development, respect for human rights, good
governance and rule of law. Our active participation in
the affairs of this Organization since independence in
1960 is indicative of our belief in its continued relevance
as a unique institution where all nations — big and small,
rich and poor, developed and developing — meet on the
basis of equality and mutual respect to harmonize their
interests and policies for the common good.
It is for this reason that we have continued to
demonstrate our commitment to work in collaboration
with Member States for the strengthening and
revitalization of the United Nations and its agencies. We
therefore believe strongly that the issue of reform and
democratization of the United Nations must be brought to
the front burner. Reform is a continuing process and is
consistent with the rapid changes taking place in our
world. Our Organization will become irrelevant if it fails
to adapt its structures and management style to present-
day realities. In this regard, my delegation wishes to
commend Mr. Kofi Annan, our Secretary-General, for his
dedication and steadfast commitment to the cause of
reform, and the generally positive attitude of Member
States to the critical issues of reform and democratization
of the United Nations.
However, we must admit that substantive progress
has been very slow because of the narrow positions which
some delegations and regional groupings have continued
to take on the fundamental issues of reform and
democratization of the United Nations. We therefore urge
all Member States to demonstrate urgent political will in
this task of renewing the Organization for the next
millennium by working out mutually acceptable
compromises that will move the reform process forward.
In doing this, we shall be able to build an Organization
with the capacity and the potential to make our world
safer and more prosperous.

With regard to the particular issue of the reform and
democratization of the Security Council — a subject to
which my country, being one of the original sponsors of the
relevant resolution, attaches great importance — I am
disheartened to note that no tangible substantive progress
has been made five years after the creation of the Open-
ended Working Group on the subject. We note here again
that mistrust and suspicion among States thwarted any
visible movement towards a successful outcome. Yet the
status quo is not in the best interest of the general
membership of the United Nations. Surely, the Council
needs to be restructured, its membership expanded in both
the permanent and non-permanent categories and its
working methods, decision-making methods and decision-
making processes improved. This is the path towards the
democratization of the Council, which will thereby enhance
the legitimacy and effectiveness of its decisions on critical
issues of global peace and security.
My delegation is also of the strong view that the
reform of the Security Council must also touch on the
proper relationship between the Council and the General
Assembly. The Charter of the United Nations assigns to the
Security Council primary, but not exclusive, responsibility
for the maintenance of international peace and security;
hence, there is also a role here for the General Assembly.
Unfortunately, however, the voice of the General Assembly,
which is the most democratic organ of the United Nations,
is often drowned out by that of the Security Council on
issues of global peace and security.
On the specific issues of the composition and size of
the Council, my delegation continues to assert that the
current anomaly of African non-representation in the
permanent membership category must be corrected as a
matter of urgency, as our continent, with its 53 Member
States, collectively constitutes almost one third of the entire
membership of the United Nations. In this context, the
decision of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to
seek two permanent seats for Africa in a reformed and
expanded Council can simply not be ignored. The demand
is legitimate, credible and made with a full sense of
responsibility and relevance in the international system. It
deserves the full support of all Member States.
It is our deep conviction that a world without the
United Nations would be inconceivable, especially in the
wake of renewed conflicts in several parts of the globe. In
this regard, it is a matter of concern that Africa accounts
for a disproportionate share of global conflicts, with their
implications for human suffering and deprivation. The scale
of human tragedies arising from conflicts within and among
African States is alarming. We are pleased to note that
the Security Council is currently giving special
consideration to the causes of conflict in our continent,
with a view to identifying how the international
community could work in partnership with us to resolve
them. This initiative to focus attention on the need for a
renewed and concerted international effort to promote
peace and stability in our continent is clearly
unprecedented and deserves our commendation.
Nigeria?s role in the furtherance of the objectives of
the United Nations, especially in the field of peacekeeping
and peace-building, is well known. We have made great
efforts in the promotion of peaceful resolution of conflicts
in parts of Africa where innocent lives and property have
been dangerously at risk. Nigeria has joined hands with
like-minded States to restore law and order. This was the
case in Liberia and, most recently, in Sierra Leone, where
President Tejan Kabbah was restored to his position as
the democratically elected President in March this year.
This was the first time in the recent history of Africa
that a democratically elected regime overthrown by a
military coup was restored as a result of a collective
action in a subregion. As the current Chairman of the
Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS), Nigeria is proud to have provided the
leadership within the ECOWAS Monitoring Group
(ECOMOG) for the collective subregional efforts which
resulted in that epoch-making event.
I should like to take this opportunity to express our
deep gratitude to the international community for its
overwhelming support during the crisis, which helped, in
no small measure, to demoralize the rebel forces and
speed up the restoration of democracy and the rule of law
in Sierra Leone. The war in Sierra Leone is over; the
same can be said of Liberia, but the threat remains. We
therefore urge the international community and
international humanitarian organizations to take an active
interest in rehabilitation efforts in the two countries. A lot
remains to be done there.
Currently our subregional grouping, through its
Committee of Seven, is actively involved in restoring
peace in Guinea-Bissau, where a rebel group took up
arms against the elected Government. It joined efforts
with like-minded groups and a result a ceasefire was
agreed upon a few weeks ago. We are optimistic that this
agreement will hold.
8


We have also helped to create within the Organization
of African Unity a continent-wide Mechanism for Conflict
Prevention, Management and Resolution. This facility
enjoys wide support. However, it has been unable to live up
to the lofty ideals for which it was set up, owing largely to
inadequate resources in terms of military hardware and
funding. We invite the international community and other
interested bodies to support the cause of peace and security
in Africa through the OAU regional and subregional
instruments for conflict prevention, management and
resolution.
Nigeria is disturbed by the escalation of terrorist
activities in many parts of the world. The recent tragic
bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, where some 260
innocent lives were lost, have brought home graphically to
us all the fact that no country or society is immune from
the activities of terrorists. We condemn these bombings.
Terrorism is one of the most heinous crimes against
humanity. It constitutes a serious threat to international
peace and security. We must enhance international
cooperation to combat and eliminate it in all its
manifestations. We must reflect our common concern for
this problem through support for an international convention
on terrorism.
My Administration came to the helm in Nigeria last
June and began its short tenure with a few clear-cut
objectives and policy thrusts. The most important is the
design and implementation of a transparent, free and all-
inclusive programme of transition to civil rule within the
shortest time-frame. This decision was welcomed by the
political class.
Our goal is to return our country to a democratically
elected civilian government on 29 May 1999. To this end,
we inaugurated the Independent National Electoral
Commission (INEC) on 11 August 1998, with full powers
to organize and manage the various stages of the electoral
process without pressure or interference from any external
body or authority. There are no restrictions to the formation
of political parties, and several political parties are already
seeking registration. The party registration guidelines just
issued by INEC emphasize the role of the electorate as the
ultimate determinant of the existence and success of
political parties. This is democracy par excellence and
confirms the confidence of Nigerians in INEC.
Furthermore, the Independent National Electoral
Commission has published the timetable for the various
elections in the Transition Programme, beginning with the
local government elections in December 1998 and
culminating in the presidential elections scheduled for 27
February 1999. We are committed to sustaining the
independence, integrity and transparency of INEC. Every
stage of the elections may be freely observed by
international monitors from the United Nations, the
Commonwealth and other interested bodies. These
measures will ensure the credibility and integrity of the
whole electoral process. In this regard, we note with
satisfaction that both the United Nations and the
Commonwealth have already dispatched assessment teams
to Nigeria to meet with INEC officials with a view to
reaching agreement on the modalities and the substance
of cooperation between the Commission and the two
organizations.
The draft constitution presented by the National
Constitutional Conference in 1995 has now been
published and will be ready for wide circulation in due
course. All comments and views arising from the public
will be duly presented for consideration prior to
promulgation.
I am aware that on the question of human rights
observance, Nigeria has recently been the subject of
international attention. It is the objective of my
administration, with the support and understanding of the
international community, to move Nigeria in the direction
of fullest respect for fundamental human rights, good
governance, accountability and rule of law. This
commitment to human rights has been amply
demonstrated by the release of political detainees, the
granting of pardons to some convicted persons and the
withdrawal of charges against others. The general level of
individual freedom, in particular freedom of expression
and association, has greatly improved. The cases of
people who are being detained and have not been
arraigned before the courts and of a certain class of
persons already convicted for offences are being
examined, and appropriate decisions will be taken.
Already, the Attorney-General and Minister of Justice of
the Federation, in conjunction with the Minister of
Internal Affairs and the National Commission on Human
Rights of Nigeria, have zoned the country for the purpose
of accelerating the decongestion of prisons.
We wish to reiterate our call on those Nigerians who
are currently in self-imposed exile to return and
participate in the political and economic development of
our country. With our quest to improve our socio-
economic infrastructure and climate for governance, we
will conduct a census of Nigerian professionals and those
9


with special talents currently excelling worldwide with a
view to harnessing all of the country?s human resources.
I have also visited all our military formations to
reconfirm the commitment of the armed forces and police
to the democratization programme. The officers and men of
the Nigerian armed forces and police, like the majority of
our people, yearn for democracy in a united and peaceful
country. They are overwhelmingly in support of our
democratization programme.
I stand before this body as the leader of a country
which is now fully engaged in a genuine and irreversible
process of transition to democracy. Therefore, having
honoured our commitment to the restoration of the
fundamental human rights and freedoms of our people and
advanced the prospects of democratization in Nigeria, we
now call on the Western countries to lift the sanctions
which some of them have imposed on our country. Today,
perhaps more than ever before, we require the support and
understanding of all the friends of Nigeria and the
international community as a whole to help us in the
implementation of our programmes and policies aimed at
uplifting the living standards of our people.
In conclusion, a silent but peaceful revolution is taking
place in Nigeria. Our people are determined to ensure that
sustainable democratic governance is established in the
country. Nigeria is clearly at the threshold of a new
beginning in its domestic political and socio-economic
structure and its foreign relations agenda. This is the time,
therefore, for the international community to give the
necessary encouragement and support for our endeavours.







1999

A little over two decades ago I
addressed this Assembly as head of a military Government
in Nigeria. On that occasion the focus of my statement was
the urgent need to terminate colonial rule in Namibia and
Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, and dismantle the racist
apartheid South Africa. Today it is a great source of joy for
me and my delegation that a distinguished son of Namibia
is presiding over the affairs of the fifty-fourth session of
the United Nations General Assembly. My delegation
assures you, Sir, of its full cooperation and unwavering
support throughout your tenure.
May I also convey through you, Sir, our deep
appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Didier Opertti of
Uruguay, for the able and efficient manner in which he
conducted the proceedings of the fifty-third session.
Our appreciation also goes to the Secretary-General,
Mr. Kofi Annan, for his visionary leadership and the
invaluable work of the Secretariat under his stewardship.
Permit me also to warmly welcome, on behalf of my
country and delegation, the Republic of Kiribati, the
Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga, which
have just joined this family of nations.
I stand before this Assembly today very proud to be
the leader of a Nigeria that has successfully managed the
transition to democracy after a decade and a half of
military rule. I would like to seize this opportunity to
express the profound appreciation of all Nigerians for the
international support and encouragement which combined
so effectively with the relentless determination of
Nigerians themselves to reconstruct and transform their
country into a vibrant democracy.
Our Administration has raised the hopes of
Nigerians, and their expectations are correspondingly
high. We are well aware of the enormity of the challenges
that we face. But we are fully resolved to tackle our
numerous social, economic and political problems head
on. And, by the Grace of God, we will not fail.
Since assuming office some four months ago our
administration has put in place an institutional framework
for the purpose of reconciling competing interests and
groups in our society. Our democratic institutions are now
operating effectively within the system of checks and
balances enshrined in our Constitution. Furthermore, we
have opted for a policy of inclusiveness in all our
political appointments, with a Cabinet, for instance, in
which all registered political parties are represented, thus
moving away from the divisive practice of winner takes
all.
Our Administration has initiated policies aimed at
revitalizing the economy in order to create an enabling
environment for investment and economic growth. We
have also put in place an appropriate legal framework for
8


the protection of foreign investments and repatriation of
legitimate profits.
Other measures that we have taken include a vigorous
anti-corruption campaign; the promotion of transparency
and accountability in public life; the abolition of decrees
and regulations which hindered the inflow of foreign
investment; the generation of opportunities for employment
and income savings for domestic investment; and the
privatization of key State enterprises, such as electricity and
telecommunications; legislation and other measures to
redress obvious cases of neglect and injustice done to ethnic
minorities, particularly in the oil-producing areas of the
Niger delta region, and to deal with the problems of the
environment; investigation of past human rights violations,
with a view to promoting and protecting fundamental
freedoms; and strengthening the capacity of the law
enforcement agencies to promote law and order, as well as
security, and to deal more effectively with the problem of
drug trafficking.
Africa is indeed proud and glad to see the end of this
century coincide with the total elimination of colonialism
and the twin menace of constitutionalized racism in the
southern part of the continent. The United Nations deserves
our warm commendation for the crucial role it has played
in this process.
Let me also pay tribute to the thousands who lost their
lives in the struggle for freedom so that those of us alive
today can proudly say we have the destiny of the continent
in our own hands. It is, however, a destiny which poses
monumental challenges in our effort to improve the quality
of life on our continent. We must strive to alleviate the
grinding poverty and material deprivation that has
persistently remained a feature of our political freedom.
As we approach the dawn of the new millennium, the
defining feature of our increasingly interdependent world is
accelerated globalization, and the liberalization of
production, trade, investment and finance.
But for us in the developing world the reality today is
quite different. Globalization, in its various manifestations,
is already experiencing a troubled relationship with the
imperatives of development.
It is rather tragic that Africa, the least developed of all
the regions and the least able to cope with external shocks,
has borne the brunt of the adverse effects of globalization
of the world economy. There are grim statistics which
indicate that the well-known marginalization of the
African continent has turned into delinkage from the
global scene.
Since 1992 Africa's exports and imports as a share
of world trade has declined from 4 per cent to 2 per cent.
Africa's development is presently straitjacketed by a debt
burden of around $300 billion. The continent is
experiencing import compression, weak productivity and
low output. On the average, factories that are still
operating do so at less than 30 per cent of installed
capacity. Africa's share in total foreign direct investment
inflows to developing countries has dropped from 11 per
cent in the late 1980s to less than 5 per cent in the second
half of the 1990s, and to a meagre 1.2 per cent of world
foreign direct investment flows in 1997.
This trend has continued, despite the efforts of
African countries to implement far-reaching economic
reforms and maintain macroeconomic stability,
particularly through the introduction of a more open and
business-friendly investment environment, and the
provision of incentives to attract foreign investment.
In the quest for a better and fairer management of a
globalized world economy, it is now incumbent upon us
to direct our searchlight on the unsatisfactory evolution of
the multilateral trading system. In participating in the
historic Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade
Negotiations that ushered in the new rules-based trading
system, the developing world had hoped that the new
trading regime would enhance their trading fortunes,
facilitate their effective integration into the world
economy, and arrest their marginalization from the global
trading system.
Unfortunately, however, the vast majority of
developing countries, particularly in Africa, have so far
been unable to reap the benefits arising from their
membership of the World Trade Organization. Africa's
trade prospects continue to be hampered by the non-
implementation of the special and differential provisions
that favour developing countries, and the increasingly
protectionist measures that are being imposed against their
export products. Besides, the paucity of technical and
financial assistance that would have enabled the
developing countries to take advantage of the limited
market access opportunities that exist continues to deepen
Africa's marginalization in the globalized world economy.
Without doubt, the biggest monetary and financial
obstacle confronting developing countries is the chronic
9


debt overhang. According to United Nations figures, the
global debt of all developing countries stood at $567 billion
in 1980, and $1.4 trillion in 1992. In that 12-year period
these countries made foreign debt payments totalling $1.6
trillion. Now, out of the 41 countries which the World Bank
describes as heavily indebted poor countries, 33 are African
countries, a group that some believe is richly deserving of
its own special category: severely indebted low-income
countries. Today in sub-Saharan Africa every man, woman
and child owes $357. This is a continent where millions
live in abject poverty, earning around $100 a year, or 27
cents a day. Some African countries now spend as much as
four times on servicing debts as they do on education and
health care. Some countries spend up to 40 per cent of their
national budgets on debt servicing. Furthermore, it is
reliably estimated that for every dollar given in official
development aid, $3 go back to the rich countries in debt
service payments.
I make bold to assert that calling for debt relief for
developing countries is not a plea for charity, but is an
urgent matter of social and economic justice. It has to be
redressed if there is to be peace and stability in the twenty-
first century. Therefore, we propose definitive debt
cancellation, not just reduction or rescheduling of the debt
service regime. Eligibility should be limited to unpayable
debts, which for Africa means the bulk of the $300 billion
current stock of debt. There should be debt remission that
is not predicated on the institutionally harsh conditionalities
of structural adjustment programmes. There should be
recognition on both sides of the bargaining table that
lenders and borrowers share joint responsibilities for debts
incurred in circumstances that are morally questionable in
the first place. Debt cancellation should benefit ordinary
people.
Nigerians rightly expect democracy to yield
perceptible dividends in their lives. Our Administration will,
however, find the task of meeting this expectation virtually
impossible without substantial reduction of our debt burden,
especially as we call on the same citizens to make the
sacrifices that are implicit in the recent measures aimed at
prudent management of our national economy.
I wish to invite the attention of the Assembly to the
related issue of illegal capital flight from Africa. It is an
open secret that much of Africa's wealth has been
illegally siphoned out of the continent by corrupt regimes
and unpatriotic individuals working in collaboration with
foreign partners. Nigeria and many African countries
would be able to pay off large portions of their debts if
only they could recover some of the capital illegally
stashed abroad. We thus believe that now is the time to
collectively deal with this issue.
In this regard, Nigeria calls for a concerted effort by
the international community, through an international
convention, for the repatriation to Africa and the
developing world of all capital illegally transferred from
these countries. Such an international convention or
agreement is legally feasible and morally sustainable. It
will compel participating banks to disclose the source of
the illegal accounts they hold, repatriate them to the
countries of rightful ownership and subject the guilty
parties to the full weight of national and international law.
It is with a heavy heart that I raise the issue of the
HIV/AIDS pandemic throughout Africa. Our continent is
bearing the brunt of this terrible disease that now kills
around 2 million Africans annually, thus officially
overtaking malaria as Africa's number one primary health-
care problem. This situation is even more frightening in
that it has now left 6 million children orphaned in the
eastern and southern parts of Africa. In West Africa the
disease has been spreading just as rapidly. Unlike malaria,
which is location specific, HIV/AIDS knows neither
climatic nor regional boundaries. Global cooperation is an
imperative if we are to succeed in dealing with this
scourge.
Among the immediate challenges facing Nigeria and
Africa today is resolving the many conflicts raging on the
continent. Today, as many as 19 sub-Saharan countries
are engaged in armed conflicts. The negative impact of
these conflicts in human, social, economic and
environmental destruction does not need to be described
here. Nigeria and indeed the entire West African
subregion have devoted considerable human, material,
political and diplomatic resources to the resolution of
these crises in the subregion, starting with Liberia and
subsequently Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau. Similarly,
efforts are being made in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo and in Angola towards peaceful resolution of their
conflicts.
10


Indeed, African leaders at the recent summit of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) in Algiers, and at the
urging of the Nigerian delegation, agreed to declare next
year as the Year of Peace, Security and Stability in Africa.
By this declaration, we have dedicated ourselves to making
the year 2000 the year when Africans direct all their efforts
into effectively eliminating armed conflicts on their
continent. We hope to build on the fresh momentum for
peace occasioned by the budding peace initiatives in Congo,
Sierra Leone, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Angola.
We are also agreed on the overriding need to uphold
codes of decency, ethics and minimum standards of
decorum among African Governments and their leadership.
Gone are the days when the OAU turned a blind eye to the
excesses and abuses of power by member Governments.
Forceful and undemocratic changes of Governments will no
longer be overlooked or tolerated. We intend to condemn
in absolute terms all violations of these codes and to
ostracize their perpetrators. It is our duty and moral
responsibility to treat our citizens decently and humanely.
My country has always believed that the threat to
international peace and security from any corner of the
globe should be considered a threat to the peace and
security of the world as a whole. While the maintenance of
international peace and security remains the primary
responsibility of the Security Council, the Charter provision
for the complementary role of regional and subregional
groups has also proved to be critical to the maintenance of
peace at the regional and global levels. The establishment
of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) is a clear
testimony of our commitment to subregional peace. As the
record shows, ECOMOG succeeded in putting an end to the
Liberian war in 1997, reinstating the democratically elected
President of Sierra Leone in 1998, and bringing about the
current Peace Agreement for Sierra Leone signed in Lomé
in July 1999.
The time has come, however, for the Security Council
to assume its full responsibility, specifically in Sierra Leone
and other conflict flash points in Africa. For too long, the
burden of preserving international peace and security in
West Africa has been left almost entirely to a few States in
our subregion. The non-implementation of the Peace
Agreement and Nigeria's continual burden in Sierra Leone
is unacceptably draining Nigeria financially. For our
economy to take off, this bleeding has to stop. The United
Nations needs to do more in providing logistics and
financial support to assist regional peacekeeping and peace-
building efforts, as well as enhancing the welfare of
refugees worldwide without discrimination.
My delegation believes that it has never been the
purpose of the United Nations Organization to prescribe
democracy and change for its members and yet make
little or no progress in the democratization of its own
organs, such as the Security Council. My delegation
accordingly urges the General Assembly, during this
session, to conclude deliberations and reach agreement on
the modalities for the reform and expansion of the
Security Council so that the Millennium Assembly will
adopt them next year — and not later.
How can the United Nations continue to perpetuate
and justify a situation where Africa is the only continent
without a permanent seat in the Security Council? In
order to promote reform and democratization of the
Security Council, Africa, with 53 Member States, should
be allocated at least two permanent seats —
commensurate not only with the continent's size and
population, but with its track record also of contributing
to the maintenance of international peace and security.
I wish to reaffirm our belief that the United Nations
is the most universal body ever designed for collectively
resolving humankind's common problems. Our
Organization has come a long way since its establishment
54 years ago. Although created in a different era and
under different circumstances, and in spite of numerous
constraints, the United Nations has continuously sought to
adapt itself to the changes in the international political
arena. It has been able to accomplish this to some degree,
but it remains an institution whose working methods,
procedures and administrative structure have in many
respects become outdated.
Yet the world as we know it today without the
United Nations would be inconceivable. For it has come
to symbolize hope for a better and more secure future for
many, particularly in the developing areas of the world.
Indeed, though a majority of our countries could not be
members when the Organization was created, we are
today its strongest defenders and advocates of the ideals
for which it stands. We believe in the family of nations,
and within that family the strong members have the
responsibility to protect and strengthen the weaker
members.
At the close of the twentieth century and the
beginning of the third millennium, there is a need for
stock-taking and for proper assessment of the



implementation of previous resolutions emanating especially
from the major world summits and conferences which took
place in this decade. Such an effort would bring us closer
to the realization of the purposes and objectives of our
Organization. In this regard, I stand before the Assembly
and pledge Nigeria's continued contributions and positive
commitment to the ideals of the Charter of the United
Nations.
