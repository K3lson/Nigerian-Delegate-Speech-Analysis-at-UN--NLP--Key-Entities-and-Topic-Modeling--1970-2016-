# Quantitative Project: Analyzing Nigerian Delegate Speeches in the UN General Assembly from 1970-2016

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the speeches made by Nigerian delegates in the United Nations General Assembly from 1970-2016. The analysis is based on key entities and topic modeling. The project utilizes natural language processing techniques to extract important information from the speeches.

**The main objectives of the project are:**
* To identify the key entities mentioned in Nigerian delegate speeches at the UN General Assembly
* To perform topic modeling on the speeches to identify the main themes and topics discussed by Nigerian delegates
* To visualize the results of the analysis for better interpretation and understanding of the data

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a CSV file containing the transcripts of the speeches made by Nigerian delegates at the UN General Assembly from 1970-2016. The dataset was obtained from the United Nations' official website. The dataset contains the following fields:
* Session date
* Speaker's name
* Speaker's country
* Speech text

## Methodology
The project consists of the following steps:

### Data Cleaning
The first step is to clean the data to remove any irrelevant information and to prepare it for analysis. This involves removing any stopwords, punctuations, and special characters, as well as stemming and lemmatizing the words in the speeches.

### Key Entity Extraction
The second step is to extract the key entities mentioned in the speeches. This involves using Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify the entities mentioned in the speeches, such as people, organizations, and locations. The entities are then grouped together and counted to identify the most frequently mentioned entities.

### Topic Modeling
The third step is to perform topic modeling on the speeches. This involves using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify the main themes and topics discussed by Nigerian delegates in their speeches. The LDA algorithm clusters the words in the speeches into topics based on their frequency and co-occurrence.

### Visualization
The final step is to visualize the results of the analysis. This involves creating various charts and graphs to display the most frequently mentioned entities and the main topics discussed in the speeches.

## Project Deliverables
The project will deliver the following items:
* Python code for data cleaning, key entity extraction, and topic modeling
* A Jupyter Notebook with detailed explanations of the data analysis steps
* Visualizations of the analysis results
* A report summarizing the findings and insights from the analysis

**Conclusion:**
This project aims to analyze the speeches made by Nigerian delegates at the UN General Assembly from 1970-2016. The analysis is based on key entities and topic modeling, and utilizes natural language processing techniques to extract important information from the speeches. The results of the analysis will provide valuable insights into the topics and issues discussed by Nigerian delegates at the UN, and will contribute to a better understanding of Nigeria's position and role in the international community.
